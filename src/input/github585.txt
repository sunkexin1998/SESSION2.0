I removed webdav plugin and tried to do sync up on the repo , I got "Error: No repository found in path, or configured plugin not installed. Use 'syinit' to create one." Maybe it's better to show which plugin is missing and provide user with a command to install it (i.e. sy plugin install webdav --snapshot)
Could not load an SSH config at work today. Something is wrong with the param parsing.
oh, forgot to clarify: i'm only talking about this part: ((resizedImage->imageData + resizedImage->widthStep*x)[y]);  so, if i'm using a cv::Mat here instead, i'd write:  resizedImage.at<uchar>(x,y);  and at least get the same resulting landmarks

 Lazy-loading SuSEfirewall2 services - some new services can be added when Yast is already running, and the config has been read already (bnc#872960) Preventing from showing incorrect service name or description if they are coming from TEMPLATE file (bnc#893583) Fixed service file parsing - comments starting with more than one '#' characters were reported as unexpected input (just warning) Test case for SuSEfirewallServices is already there

@NobodysNightmare the given file appears to work for me. I'm not using Windows but I don't think that should matter. Is it possible you are running out of memory on your machine? What if you only render say half the document?"
Same Problem here :-(
@masterbee There were delays of keyboard display / resetting so fixed that. Also fixed the colour staying when closing with escape and left. Also added the ability to support more than one menu on a page as it was preventing me from deploying mega menus in the main bar (since the example and the site menu were conflicting with one another). Also moved some of common CSS from the .hbs into the .scss since didn't make sense to repeat it in theme files (since had nothing to do with colours).Still need to add navigate by first letter and such but this helps out a lot."
 I doubt it has anything to do with either Tilemill or Mapbox-studio.  Thinking about it, you might be right. A pixel width of 0 is absurd, and that's probably coming from Mapnik?  This post (http://sqlbrain.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/avoid-sql-divide-by-zero-errors-by-using-nullif/)Ya I've ended up using NULLIF to work around the divide by zero error. It might screw up the Tilemill data display but I don't use that anyways.seems to indicate that it happens only when no rows are returned. So the lack of error in Tilemill may be because some rows are being returned.That's specific to that situation where if no rows are returned COUNT(*) is 0 so you get a division by zero. In this situation it's a divide by zero regardless of how many rows would otherwise be returned."
Yes, directly to master would do right now. Thanks very much @decanus"

 The home office of Nanotrasen's day to day affairs, CentCom is a secure and centralized space station at a classified location. Everything about them is thorough and professional, and to date there have been no successful attacks or infiltrations reported to the company newsletter. It comes fully stocked and self-sufficient at all times and is a safe haven for all employees of Nanotrasen's many holdings. There's even an advanced neural programming lab and vast cloning bay to provide excellent and rehabilitative health care for elite Nanotrasen employees!  That's what it said until April 15th, 2014 when Jordie for some reason decided to completely reverse it. Headcanon is far, FAR more important than any "lore" dictated by one person especially when it does a better job of answering certain quirks of gameplay.

Plugin fnSetFilteringDelay does not work anymore with DataTables version 1.10 due to changes in the api.Following code does the same what the plugin was supposed to do and works with DataTables 1.0:https://github.com/xmojmr/component.io/blob/0.2.0/js/main.js#L395-L420It would be nice if the fnSetFilteringDelay was working also with 1.0 but there are several questions in the current design that made me to propose just a copy/paste hack instead of pull request. Especially:DataTables has already support for this behavior built-in in the form of function _fnThrottle(fn freq).

https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile/blob/master/xapi-scorm-profile.md#objectivesI don't think tracking objectives is so common so there's less of a well worn path here and there's certainly merit to using http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/passed as described in this document.Watershed LRS (http://site.watershedlrs.com/) uses http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/completed and this is the only ADL verb to actually mention objectives in its description. For this reason completed is my preference.easygenerator authoring tool (https://www.easygenerator.com/) uses http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/mastered which also seems to a a reasonable choice though perhaps that should be reserved more for competencies than learning objectives."
Currently if you type in a invalid value into a double field, it is not saved until it is validated, when you have finished editing, eg. clicked on another cell in the table, or pressed enter, the table checks if the value in the changed cell is valid. Is that what you mean ?

well, yes, having 2 different messages will improve the quality of the report, that's for sure.
I'm not sure I agree with this. I see the point you're trying to make but I wouldn't necessarily put it there by default. You can get that kind of information from metadataBuilder, but of course that doesn't end up in the same file. I would rather make the capability optional by introducing something like templateBuilder where you define your own template for specs - I think that would be more universal.

Well, currently making a zip for Cydia is a no-brainer.  We basically just use the entire repo.  What I'm thinking we'll need to do instead is to create separate repos for each theme.  The icons repo will have iPad, iPhone and source icon images.  Then we'll have to have a build script that will compile only the iPad icons into the iPad theme and the iPhone icons into the iPhone theme. If we decide to go the iPad route @dreamnetSome GUI them subfoldersome-iphone-gui-control.pngthe-same-gui-control-but-the-ipad-version.pnginfo.iphone.plistinfo.ipad.plistThen we have the build script rename the plist files depending on which Glasklart theme we're building.  So in BOTH themes both the iPhone and iPad items would be in there but in the iPad version it would have the iPad plists and vice versa."

+1 on removing let for declarations.

Your effect was always broken on any GPU that didn't do 32-bit per channel floating point textures. For less capable cards the component not only supported R32G32B32A32F but also R10G10B10A2 and R8G8B8A8 integer textures. 0.2.45 removed floating point and 10-bit textures leaving just 8-bit as it's good enough for pretty much any content. Common to both of those is that their range is only positive numbers, interpreted when shading as [0..1] while the floating point texture is [-1..1]. The stock effect has code to fix up this bias and it seems that whoever wrote your effect stripped out the unbias operation. // alpha 1 indicates biased texture float4 minmaxrms = tex1D(sTex, tc.x); minmaxrms.rgb -= 0.5 * minmaxrms.a; minmaxrms.rgb *= 1.0 + minmaxrms.a;

The problem seems to be that the version of cabal that you are using to install the package does not match the version Cabal-1.16.0.3 needed to compile the Setup.lhs file.

The update intervals are probably too low, GPS inaccuracy may have too high effect on the measured parameters. For example if horizontal accuracy is 60 meters and the users moves 70 meters, GPS will provide a number between 40 and 100 which is very inaccurate. If user moves 300 meters with the same accuracy and prolonged update interval, the provided value will be between 270 and 330 which is much better.

Per conversations in SF today, a few points that seem relevant:  Moving the registration (e.handleFallThroughRequests(['/resources', '/font']);) to onactivate is non-controversial. Registrations overwrite each other and last-one-wins semantics prevail. We need an API for examining the fall-through registrations The fall-through handler (e.g., b.com's handler for a fetch that a.com generates) should probably have a different event name, e.g. onfallthroughfetch to prevent naive reuse of onfetch logic that isn't suited to dealing with requests from third parties CORS is hard. Logically, any fetch() from a.com, either from it's documents or Service Workers, that reach a fallthrough event handler should allow b.com's onfallthroughfetch to see CORS preflights and respond appropriately. Logically speaking, b.com's SW is executing across the network from a.com's perspective To prevent abuse, responses from onfallthroughfetch should probably be made opaque by default and explicit action, perhaps in the form of a different Response object type or an argument to respondWith should be necessary to make a response non-opaque.

If you wrap that with a div of class horizontal-form then that might work better.Second there's a margin-bottom on p from fjord.less. If you set horizontal-form > p margin-bottom to 20px that seems to fix some of the alignment issues."

this changeset introduces the following behavior:  threads will now either display new posts since the user's last visit OR  the 20 most recent posts. threads now fetch an additional page of posts when the user wants to see earlier posts (instead of fetching all of the remaining posts). the old behavior still exists and currently can be triggered via the same query param (all=true).  Fixes #125 and #137"
Hi Mark, I have this week more time, will respond to your thread.
Hi. I have been using sublimetext2 on windows 7 for a few months and Super Calculator was one of my favorite plugins. Now I have moved on sublimetext3 on Ubuntu 13.04 and when I press Alt+C it doesn't select the expression. If I select the expression and press Alt+C it goes on as expected, replacing the expression with the result. Is this a bug or am I missing something?
thanks @bertinatto I made some comments. I think we may want to allow logging out too. Otherwise once you're logged in you're stuck. What do you think?"
Thanks, I will integrate a similar change but I think the offset should be applied to UV coordinates in the ImBitmapFont::RenderText function?
what is your build?
You were fast on this one, thanks @tucksaun."

Reviewed and approved.
Also....Ctrl-PageUp changes tabs in Firefox and Chrome which mean that we can't implement it in a way where it meets everyone's expectations. Also it seems like those instructions would make sense to a screen reader user(except for the change year) bit not necessarily to a sighted keyboard only user. It seems like the current one isn't meeting the ARIA spec exactly either so I think we will have to create a hybrid.
I'm not sure what causes this, but running the following will call the "bad" or "bad2" callbacks many (hundreds of) times. The two "ok" callbacks work fine and were found as I was trying to isolate the problem. #!/usr/bin/python
 What's the use case where you put a trailing comma at the end of a destructuring pattern ?  When one span multiline I guess: js> [ a,       b,     ] = [        0,       1,     ] [0, 1]  Admittedly not very useful in Coffee families since we don't need those commas at all.

From hwa...@gmail.com on August 12Two more things:We should attribute the framework and the miniupnp guys somewhere.According to this (http://code.google.com/p/tcmportmapper/wiki/BasicUsage) we canremove a plist file (because we don't use the router name feature) and save 434K fromthe filesize.

Sorry, but I don't really see why that'd be the case. We just have to add the contents of each file into the files key, right? https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/#create-a-gist"
As far as I know, BWA only accepts gzipped FASTA files during indexing, or as sequences to align. In either of these cases, BWA only needs to read the files sequentially and does not do any random access via byte offsets. bedtools getfasta needs to seek to specific offsets within the FASTA file, and these offsets cannot be calculated from a gzipped file. This probably won't happen.

Propagate the changes from the new TrackingParticles to the trackingParticleRecoTrackAsssociation  and the V0 validator. Also, use the (now faster) trackingParticleRecoTrackAsssociation in the MultiTrackValidator so that a further speed gain is achieved. On events with PU~20 (runTheMatrix 202.0) it reduced the time of trackingParticleRecoTrackAsssociation by 94% (!) and of trackValidator by 20%. The output should be unchanged.

Hello, The default keybinding to move between workspaces is Ctrl-Alt-arrow key. I change this to simply Ctrl-arrow key, and this worked fine in Cinnamon 1.4. I changed the setting using the GNOME settings keyboard shortcuts editor. In Cinnamon 1.6, this no longer seems to work. The GNOME settings keyboard shortcuts editor still shows my workspace navigation settings as Ctrl-arrow key, but the only way I can move between workspaces from the keyboard is Ctrl-Alt-arrow key. I'm using Ubutnu 12.04 64-bit with Cinnamon 1.6 via the gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable PPA. This is a fundamental part of my desktop navigation, and it extremely frustrating to have to workaround.
lgtm, and thanks!

Hi @davidbiehlYea that is a rough edge since it is not mentioned that template files are compiled to name.js."
I am able to select an image but not sure if the annotation is working or not because once I make one, I can never see it again. maybe it's hidden behind the large image? similarly, when i elect a text input or button, or radio button, the annotation just doesn't to work. is there a workaround this or is this a bug?
I noticed that in newer versions of Python accessing the key "content-disposition" leads to a KeyError as the key will be named there "Content-Disposition" after converting url_lib.urlopen(url).info() to a dictionary.

Now there is a Django template tag "map" that renders a project map with the following syntax: {% map project 260 180 'static' %} and {% map organisation 400 300 'dynamic' %} For maps with all projects: {% map 'projects' 975 600 'dynamic' %} On page load a javascript will grab all map elements from the page and render them with the correct data from the template tag. I'm consider renaming 'map' to akvomap' or something more namespacy.
Any other method should raise an exception.
In the source code of sinon 1.7.1 I find that forEach is used in the definition of function "FakeXMLHttpRequest". But forEach is not supported in IE7/8 so I'm afraid this is the key factor.

 thanks for your feedback.I understand your doubts and I can keep this feature outside my fork of EXT:bootstrap_package.These classes are intended for advanced users and based on my experience I think that these are useful in some cases if used in the right way to solve particular design problems without create more custom layouts.== uid / parend.uid ==It's true that they could get lost but and advanced designer/developer should know how to handle this problem. Btw I used alias // uid so it's possible to use the alias of the page to bypass this problem.== language.uid ==I don't see the need of a "speaking" class cause I guess that advanced users know how to handle languages uid ;)== template ==I didn't mention "templates" I talked about "layout" or did I miss something?== layout ==See following Typoscript. In this case classes names related to layouts could be shortened to taste.In case of one page I tested it and the body tag is taken from the root page then no problem here as far as I can see."

Pull requests don't have to be full, the idea is to get a conversation going around a chunk of code. As it is right now, manual patching has to go on, which discourages others from helping out.
Status.net groups were always a misguided misfeature.  Groups on status.net are just hashtags that you can follow... but properly implemented hashtags should be followable, making the extra syntax redundant and annoying.

This is expected. .color1 .color2 a:hover is a subselector of .color2 a:hover, meaning that every element matched by .color1 .color2 a:hover is also matched by .color2 a:hover. The same is true for .color2 .color1 a:hover of .color1 a:hover. So Sass trims the unnecessary generated selectors, producing the output above.

Though I'm not the maintainer of the official debian images (i.e. I don't build them, I just maintain the bootstrapper) I'd hazard a guess and say that it will boot through grub, or at least I'll strongly urge the maintainer to do so (bootstrap-vz can install & configure either extlinux or grub). It's sad really. I like extlinux. It's a lot easier to set up than grub and is built with simplicity in mind, but the state of the debian package in jessie right now makes it pretty much impossible to install/configure and maintain through kernel updates. I sincerely hope someone will step up to the challenge and apply the finishing touches to the package (and from what I've seen it's not a lot that's required).

Well, we have this exact case: a daemon is periodically fetching collection of tasks from a db table, and new tasks get started, old tasks get deleted, and changed tasks get restarted.

 calling it disruptive at all makes no sense to me because the only way in which development is every a disruption is if there are other things that we'd prefer to be doing but cannot.  That's not what I have meant. Let's find a different expression then, instead of disruptive. How would you describe a step which we really want to make, but which will mean that we will have to go back a few steps, and redesign and re-implement stuff which was already working once? I am happy to use a different expression instead of disruptive; this is the meaning that I wanted to convey.

Analysis: The pattern match failure is no big deal, but it cannot be fixed until the second issue is fixed. The second issue is a bit more serious. The ILAst after the last ILAst transform is as follows: finally {     stloc:IDisposable(var_2_2F, isinst:IDisposable([mscorlib]System.IDisposable, ldloc:IEnumerator(var_1)))     if (logicnot(ldloc:IDisposable[exp:bool](var_2_2F))) {         endfinally()     } else {     }      callvirt:void(IDisposable::Dispose, ldloc:IDisposable(var_2_2F))     endfinally() }  That code is technically correct, but it cannot easily be transformed into a C# AST without introducing an unnecessary goto, since C# provides no mechanism for leaving a finally block other than by falling through the bottom. I tested some other code, and have found that pretty much every case involving more than one endfinally in a finally block can cause similar problems. I have further checked the code, and endfinally is simply dropped on conversion to the C# AST, which is only valid if it is the last statement in the finally block. With that in mind, the best fix that I can see is to create a special basic block consisting of only a label and an endfinally(), and replace the endfinally() calls in other basic blocks with a branch to this block. (Do not forget that endfinally() can take arguments with side effects which may need to become stand-alone expressions). The new endfinally basic block cannot be incorporated into a loop or conditional structure, and must be the very last basic block merged into the flattened block. This is to ensure that it will be the last instruction in the finally block so that the C# code has execution just fall out the bottom of the finally block. The above would not need to be done with any finally block that does not contain an endfinally, which is permissible if it always either does not terminate or throws an exception. (All of this would also apply to fault blocks.)

A visitor pattern already breaks some encapsulation but the trade-off for the coupling is acceptable because of the generality of the mechanism. I did not add a method like this because I consider the decision to process a node's children to be a component of the specific visitor's state. I would like to see what the code looks like using these approaches before deciding whether to include this method:  The visitor maintaining state that says whether to process node X when it is a sub-node of Y The visitor deciding to call #lazy_visit (or whatever the method is named) when node X is a sub-node of Y Changing #visit to required a return value that specifies whether to recurse into the children when the node is Y  Do you have time to code these three approaches so we can compare them? I would be most inclined to support 3 above. It is still generic, without duplicating the method and allows for a mixed approach on any particular iteration of a tree, as opposed to 2 above which requires deciding to use #lazy_visit in place of #visit. To be clear, both 1 and 3 require maintaining some state in the visitor, but the logic associated with that state appears preferable to logic deciding between calling #visit or #lazy_visit.
I'm going to close this issue.  We can always raise another one for next week's get-together.

Hi! Thanks for an excellent library. This fixes a couple of issues:  The settings for 125kbaud were incorrect, leading to errors arduino.h should be Arduino.h; on case-sensitive filesystems this fails. 
Thanks for fixing that part! I think it's now overall done.
The ViewModel and the MvxCommand is in a Portable Class Library, and it doesn't work in both Windows 8.1 Project and Windows Phone 8.0-Silverlight Project. I don't get the Point with the non-generic MvxCommand, since it doesnt pass a parameter. So I guess it works, because the CommandParameter isn't touched at all.

Our maps will operate on GeoJSON views of places (maybe even people?). The mapping javascript in an HTML page like places/42 will look for a link with a GeoJSON data uri (see http://sgillies.net/blog/958/geojson-data-uris/). For example:  This saves us from an extra XSLT run and extra request per place. We probably still want to have a GeoJSON file for all places."

Yes we have a similar issue with openSUSE. The problem really is the breed abstraction; unfortunately there are differences within a breed.

Hi Mike, Are you on the network and can write to your home directory? You can confirm this by pasting the path into the location bar of Windows Explorer and creating a new file or folder there: \icnas1.cc.ic.ac.ukmb4514  You might try using a local path instead, ie on your C drive. Here's a revised version of the install script presuming you've already successfully installed the necessary packages (the first part).  Notice the new variable which you should update to a writable local location. # set this path to a writable local directory (note forward slashes)dir_local = 'C:/Users/mburgass/Documents'

From rnk@google.com on October 15I agree with the UTF-8 plan but I'm wondering if the encoding wouldn't be so hard to do without ntdll if that proves difficult.  Are wchar_t * strings always UTF-16 or can they be something else?  I can't find a straight answer.If it's always UTF-16 it shouldn't be too hard to write something that just does codepoint conversions and ignores subtle issues like case whitespace numbers and normalization."
Is this a use case that we are worried about?  Will it be typical for our users to provide images that have a singleton z dimension? In some cases, there's already a simple workaround: Use the dataset properties editor to change the axis order from xyzc to xytc.  (That's not an option if your image started with txyzc, though...) Perhaps we could add a new convention for squeezed axes: txy-c or something like that.

Hi, I'm using both the streaming and the REST api in my application.

As you can see on the tests you can receive a value in the post data that you can use to get another value/object that is the one you actually want to store in your new object. Using this approach avoids overwriting the obj_create method like in this case: def obj_create(self, bundle, **kwargs):     kwargs['author'] = User.objects.get(username=bundle.data['username'])      bundle = super(CustomNoteResource, self).obj_create(bundle, **kwargs)     return bundle

Well, whatever your goal is, if your run the code in a plain browser or in a sugar web activity, it is currently a different platform, for the meaning I'm giving to that word at least.

I ported a large portion of the Graphserver core over to Java, and I'm beginning to run some benchmarks on a real-world street graph of the Seattle area. Test 1 (85th street to beacon hill) Java: 646 ms C: 23 ms (28x faster) Test 2 (ballard ave to lake city way) Java: 277 ms C: 9 ms (30x faster) I'll get these benchmarks polished off and send out for peer-review soon, but it's not looking too good for Java. That's too bad, because abstract classes are exactly what Graphserver is all about. In the case of Graphserver, which aims to be a calculating engine for a mission-critical piece of infrastructure, I think speed is nearly the most important consideration. It may be less portable, but it also requires one thirtieth the computational resources. For a piece of software I fully expect to peg servers and require horizontal scaling, that literally means you'd need thirty times as many machines to keep up with the same load. I think that'd cost more than an extra half a day figuring out how to install it. --bmander

@jodastephen do you know if this issue can be a bug or afterwards this is just how Java 8 behaves and we have to live with it?"
I thought I will implement it by myself, but currently I have no time for it. So I just write down the idea in case somebody will like it and implement, or in case I will return back to it next year. The idea is to extend the definition of variables so the strings could be used as the access-keys in addition to integer numbers. One can think of them as std::map<string,string>, or python dictionary, or lua tables which are the closest. Possibility to use dictionaries exists also in bash/zsh, though dictionaries are distinct from ordinary variables. Why it is useful? The latest example I saw is in __terlar_git_prompt, where you need to get a color and symbol for named elements in a list: for i in $fish_prompt_git_status_order    if contains $i in $gs      echo 'set_color $fish_color_git_'$i      echo 'echo -n $fish_prompt_git_status_'$i    endend | .Where $i runs the items from the list: added modified deleted etc.If one could use variables as dictionaries this piece of code could be rewritten in the following way:for i in $fish_prompt_git_status_order    if contains $i in $gs      set_color $fish_color_git[$i]      echo -n $fish_prompt_git_status[$i]    endendWhich for me looks much nicer and simpler.How not to break the ordinary variables?That is actually very simple. The idea is almost the same as in lua tables (http://lua-users.org/wiki/TablesTutorial):If the key is number it refers to the 'array' part of the variable which is what a variables currently.If the key is a string (starts from a letter for example) it refers to the dictionary part.Dictionary part should not affect all the previous behaviour. "$variable" is expanded to a list of array part. 'count $variable' will print the number of elements in the array part."set var " also works only with the array part.The differences comes with handling subscription:'set var[key] value' or 'set var[key1 key2] value1 value2' should be expanded to handle string keys.$var[key] or $var[$key] or $var[key1 key2] should return values which were previously set.There should also be functions for working with dictionaries like getting list of keys for iteration or getting the number of elements in dictionary part.set var[a b c] d e fecho $var  #-><nothing>count $var #->0get --size var   #-> 3get --keys var   #-> a b c get --values var #-> d e fget --pairs var  #-> a d b e c fOther issuesOne should also update universal variables handling.Dictionary part of the variables could not be exported.Thats itAny ideas/thoughts/critics are appreciated."
This pull request is meant for discussion. The implementation works, but I'm quite sure there is room for further improvement, esp. regarding m2e integration of the maven-plugin.

Yes. I am building menu items with cocoa and aura in mind. So far targeting cocoa primarily and keeping in mind that I will have to make it work for aura. I do believe for aura we may need to be able to get all of the current windows for setting the menu on each window. This would mean being able to get all the current exo shell bindings that have been created. We can do this on the breach side if its easier, but keeping in mind that multiple processes may be able to connect to a running service of exobrowser, this would lead to network segmentation if we managed this on breach side. (This could either be a desired effect or an undesired effect.) For now the simple case is 1 breach instance :: 1 exo browser instance, but there may be instances where mutiple breach instances are talking to 1 exo browser instance.

Mozilla seems to have left it for a while, so pulling to me is the best for now
Clang version = 3.5 GCC version = 4.8.2
This also introduces a d3.touch method and changes the drag behavior to listen to the target element of the touchstart event rather than the window, avoiding a crash when a DOM element is removed while dragging. You can now temporarily remove a DOM element while dragging, and later add it back while still dragging, and it will be in the right place. I might consider leaving the d3.touch method private for now so that we can roll this out as a 3.4.x, and making d3_touch public in the 3.5 release.
Fair enough.
Will it continue to work after an update of the app? Updating sometimes brakes the shortcut..
I was thinking of making it dependent of what the user chooses to do. i.e. 1) User clicks on the (if in wondow mode) window close gadget -> close scummvm User chooses to use SDL quit (ALT-X) or any other backend quit -> close scummvm User chooses to bring up the scummvm menu (F5)  Two possibilties here a) Quit or Exit -> close scummvm b) Return to Launcher -> go back to DOTT (I think that would be a good and logicalway because I - The user knows he's playing a game inside a game and shouldn't complain about :-) II - You don't want the user to start any other game and cause problems)  User chooses to quit the game with the internal scumm command (CTRL-Q?) -> close Maniac Mansion (and go back to DOTT)Not sure if any of that could be achieved in a clean way"
Are you using StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle ? it seems like the user object is not in identity map of unit of work of doctrine. It would be easier if it could be reproduced. which version of symfony and doctrine orm are you using?
See #2240"
@anodynos I feel a little concerned that the alternative implementation does necessitate a views cache. Are we effectively saying to developers seeing Backbone for the first time that they must manually manage this problem with persistent view stores?. @jashkenas I've tested the above using the additional logging but the calls cited seem sporadic. I'm wondering if this is really the zombies issue at all but it's probably specific to our app as it uses filtering."
I think auto-submitting to cause a full page refresh would be a pretty bad experience, so I'd probably prefer they had to trigger the submit manually.
@dpobel I would better say no.  eZDebug::writeError() may log **RunTime** errors but is not really suitable for errors that is the direct result of bad programming and should fail hard like if a typo was made in a class or method name.
That's fine for now. I may merge them if I get some time.
This is a minor bug fix, should be 0.1.1.  ```python print "hello" ```  - list 1 - list 2  
Do not add a newline between if() and  the following statement. Check framework code about it. @rawtaz Check Yii source code about newlines. There is no Symfony/Zend/other code style.
Done. Renamed "timestamp" to "freeze-date".  I'm actually setting "build-date" to the actual day that the image is built because it can differ from the freezedate.
Can we use something more descriptive than 1 and 0?
Remove space after commas.
I'd like to keep the YourKit stuff out of the oae module. You can deliver a custom setenv.sh.erb template via the setenv_template param to oae::app::server   If you add the YK java arguments to localconfig/templates/oae-setenv.sh.erb then the oae module w
What a load of rubbish
Yep, you are right, the problem is that we don't know if more headers have been added. Another option is to create a 'refresh' method and call it from outside every time a new header is created/removed. Makes sense for me.
clean that please.
Here's that bug I was talking about. Pipe character is a regexp special character. Needs to be escaped to match.
Will fix -- I didn't read the "Contributing" file before contributing. :)
I think I'd like to either do this, or remove the comment; if there's a need for the method to change, we'll feel it anyway.
We could probably make this change in `master`, unless it was accidental?
The @param type of $data is StdClass . This is not fixed . Let me know if its ok .
I think we could probably use a stronger selector here; this will match any other link that happens to use the organisation name.
Nah, "object" should be fine; all objects are of StdClass anyway. If PhpDocumentor complains, we'll change it.
@jeffheifetz i vote we don't use a status flag at all. See my comment about editing the existing keepSource flag.
country code instead of currency codes?
I feel like an option passed in with the request would make more sense. If you want to enable it globally it could be an option to initialize as well. This should not be the default as it breaks backwards compatibility.
I believe this expression would be easier to understand:  ```lambda stack: any('CreatePairedMinidumps' in signature for signature in stack)```  it reduces to one level of parens and drops the confusing `find` and `-1`   
This could be DRYed up in a similar manner to the chart_col_title in the controller, since the dd always has the same value, and only the value of the dt changes.  So, something like  <code>&lt;dt><%= (stat.to_s.titleize == "Comments") ? ts("Comment Threa
Should these functions be exported?
Does this documentation explain anything?  Switch `#'` to `#` ?
@pmjones Yes @phpdocumentor was complaining . I discusses with @mvreil and he mentioned to add `\StdClass` as param
This is terrific!
Classes that don't have a toJSONString method don't need a loadFromJSONObject method.  Back out this change.
It is 1 at the moment, because I was restricting everything to R^2 to get something working.  I'm going back over the kmeansp and kmeansbi to extend them for R^M, which is what we have already done with the gomatrix library.  You are correct about the
I think if we are going to spend the effort to update the deps, we should spend the effort to minimize there declarations as well.
This probably should be "unneeded". However, I would suggest "unnecessary", as I think it's used more.
Again, I don't think we want to confuse new users with this. If you want a literal, use 'key' instead - seasoned SpEL users will know they can use a SpEL literal here.

I like 'adapter' and we already have (with quick search) AmqpInboundChannelAdapter
The padding should be set to (8,0,8,0) to ensure that it causes no regressions.
It looks to me like this call to service_registered has the desired effect of removing the service from the riak_api_pb_server's dispatch state; however I don't think it's `states` are being treated as cleanly. I'm not sure if that matters, but I think it
Do you want to try moving the unicode character to the end so it's the last thing before the newline?
I agree about magic. :)
Well, that is not wrapped in an SPCA.  A quick check of sublasses of AbstractPollingInboundChannelAdapterParser point to classes ending with MessageSource - the method is called 'parseSource' after all :-)  ```` protected BeanMetadataElement parseSource(E
We may want to call requestLayout() when setting the shadow layer as well.
Wow,  that seemed to trigger it.
This IS a MessagSource, so yes RedisStoreMessageSource is the right name. The SPCA is the adapter, delegating to a source.  The AmqpInboundChannelAdapter is different. It's an active component (not polled) that extends MessageProducerSupport so it has the

What happens when the user sets only one of shadow color or shadow offset?  Should we have some default values for these? If both are needed, we should only call setShadowLayer() when both are present.
Similar to the comment above, what happens when you call setShadowLayer() when 0 for some of these fields?
Please also pull 9f59a0b7fd0eaff72b80e9741337d596bb885a4c to remove the now redundant check
If you're deregistering a range of codes, it calls set_env once per code, unlike during registration, where it updates the dict once per code, but calls set_env just once for the range.
Good catch. This is probably spammy and race-prone.

Usually, var statements with multiple lines are indented once more to the right (IMO better readability), but your call, that is an opinion, and a nitpick. :-)
I agree with this concept, but I think we need a more descriptive fact name here.
Instead of using 'h', perhaps we should use constants? Imho that would make the code more legible.
AFAIK the goal is to keep vars out of quotes  $line . "\n"
CS, line ending missing
I should probably add measures to ShapePart if we want them to be useful. Right now it's very difficult to index into the measures array to find the values for a specific part.
I think "estimatedSize" is better indeed...  "estimatedGainForLeftSafeLiteral"  is good too.
This line does nothing, I used it to have a breakpoint for debugging. You can delete it.
can we do this? ``` private static final GetKeyFunction GET_KEY_FUNCTION... private static final GroupTupleFunction GROUP_TUPLE_FUNCTION... ```
Can't this just be elseif() ?
use i18n "trans"
Is this an error in imagebuf.h:  reres (const ImageBuf &spec)  Should it not use ImageSpec instead? I see the implementation only needs a spec.
CS, spacing
Still not sure about contents validation, since as a single function it turns out to be quite ugly :|
$output already had a value assigned on line 309. Not sure if overwriting that is the way to go.  If correct I would suggest: if (!$head) {    $output = $tableText->render(); } else {   //  ... this code block;
I think we should use of a sekizai tag here to provide the css resources so that the style is available in any cms page.

ideally this would go in a `beforeEach` since it's needed for every test

Not strictly necessary, but one of the box tests in Veewee checks to see if Puppet is installed. I had to flip a coin to decide whether to remove the Puppet stuff and leave that test failing or not. If you have a strong opinion either way, it can certainl
It's too bad it's still version 1.8.7 in the CentOS 6 base repo ...
Also, the intent was to leave these boxes and configs publicly available, and it seems the community standard is to have both Puppet and Chef available.
\ No newline at end of file
Paddy, could you please leave the old tests in there as well? That way we ensure there are no BC issues (or at least become aware were there any).
A little indentation wouldn't hurt. Can't say much about the rest of this.  "if it works, it works for me ;)"
So what do we do about that bug?
yay!
Is this github being stupid?
Circles don't have vertices :)  But actually is this even used anywhere? It looks like `drawShape()` just calls `g.circle()`
Actually the indentation is not possible here because I used some white spaces to indent the XSLT output. This is a general XLST file to convert a docBook structure in reStructuredText format. I used the XSLT syntax + the special template php:function() u
Yes, that's true.
There are just 4 points here, so the square isn't being closed. If you add `true` as the last element in the path, it will auto-close the shape (and make the starting/ending vertex look better than if you just repeated the first coordinate)  `v = [[x - si
This is about the last method in the Symfony2 doc (3. Without using ACL) but I don't think it's a good idea to implement it
Good catch. Done!
Oh, no, not a good idea ;)
I like it. :ok_hand:
Kinda hacky, I know. :(
Actually, you might have to just leave off the last `[x,y]` here and `v.push(true)` after you recenter below.
I think prefixing the modules with "mvc-" and having the `Y.MVC` namespace is confusing. How about this for the module names:  * `todo` provides `Y.Todo` * `todo-list` provides `Y.TodoList` * `todo-view` provides `Y.TodoView` * `todo-app` provides `Y.Todo
This could become an Attribute of the app (that's make it more YUI-like).
I don't mind, I am okay with that.  While I am at it, I must warn you  though, I am currently making *huge* changes on the tree structure (see #946). I don't know how we should resolve our future conflicts :/ 
I'm responsible for this.  Sorry.
I believe we can actually change the `:url` to be `:url => 'https://papertrailapp.com/api/v1'` to cut down on the typing and not need to define the `@api_prefix`. It's one of the things I really like about faraday.
You should just be able to pass the `group` hash directly in as the second argument to `@connection.post()` without needing to convert it to a string. Were you having problems with that?
Might be useful to pass the `{asList: true}` option so you get a ModelList instance back from this.
Limitation?  I would call that a show-stopper.
Don't hard code these values. Use:    bb::device::DisplayManager displayManager;   bb::device::Display& display = displayManager.getDisplay(displayManager.primaryDisplayId());   QSize size = display.pixelSize();    dCapsObject->Set(String::NewSymbol("plat
Fixed in source - sorry, the comment can be deleted.
That is mainly because `getReference` is an ORM specific method
Since we should ideally move to `Doctrine\Common` and eventually extend the features here with more specific/optimized logic, that's why I suggested to use `find`
this is a bit hard to read.  a better pattern might be: ``` Locale locale = Locale.getDefault(); if(arrayBinaryContains(locale.getLanguage(), "ja", "ko", "zh") || arrayBinaryContains(locale.getCountry(), "BZ", "CA", "KE", "MN", "US"))      ... do stuff ``
From what I can infer from the controller, the user (admin) is supposed to set this in a form, so attr_accessible should be fine for deprecated.
How about "nonce range" vs "full work"?
For clearInterval and clearTimeout functions, platforms are not mentioned.
Average is generally abbreviated "Avg" ("Ave" is "Avenue")
Style (commas should be followed by a space)
This probably won't work. Did you test all those?
Done
Can you rename `urls_or_config_hashes` to something less verbose? I think `nodes` is fine, as it is `#add_node` that is finally concerned with what to do with the contents.
Style
You're making Capybara dependent on jQuery??? A *huge* no to this.
It would be nice to have specs for these changes, and not just in the RSpec matchers!
Replace L80-83 with        this.settingGroups.splice(         this.settingGroups.indexOf(this.defaultGroup), 1);
Yeah, agreed. But where besides RSpec matcher specs?
I've tried plone.batching in my dev environment but it breaks the "standard_view" template from plone.app.collection because it uses the oldstyle CMFPlone batch_macros ... so this has to be changed there too, before merging thisone. 
Ah yes, totally right
worth sending this to crew or techteam?
Don't we need to drop this?
See above.
Even though I think we've come a long way from C89, I'll move the declaration to the top!  Also, good call on using `gettimeofday()`.
ah, thanks!
hmm, any chance that this will fail with an infinite loop?
I actually meant a getter not a delegated method :)
Ah, thanks
I believe all the BitVector values are given names with the k prefix. For example, https://github.com/H-uru/libhsplasma/blob/master/core/PRP/Object/plObjInterface.cpp#L20
If the pull request  for #195 gets given the go ahead, I'd be happy to convert this to be a new descriptor-style GSObject.  It looks very good, and great to have the new improved factors for HLR and FWHM.
yes, a small point.    mostly concerned with having an approachable api.
As has happened before, I have to confess to not feeling very qualified to comment on this Tree stuff, having not coded up anything similar in the past myself...
Great that you harmonized these `pad_factor` params to the python-layer style.
I think we still need this for some use cases (I know I had some) - or should it be an argument to __init__ ?
Oh sorry, I see that it's moved above ...
Do you think we need to have open and close strings other than the default ones?
This was here because of our annoying plugin VoxelBorder. It blocks people otherwise.
I really like how you have refactored this method!
In my installation, I had to change this to `File.join(page.source_dir` instead of `page.dir`. This was for paginating blog/index.html; as-is it kept generating the `page2` folder in the root directory instead of in `blog/`, as `page.dir` just returned `/
This type of if statement only needs to be on the base classes.  I would just put the code in this block at the top level and get rid of the test.  See `Cell` and `TextCell` for an example.  I know this is very weird.
The notebook is currently broken in this branch.  Due to typo here: should be `add_button_group`.
Am I being totally dense, or is this a square region?  (If so, I was a little confused by the mention of R at line 390)
Ah, I see, later you also build a lookup table for the x values, hence it becomes "analytic" in the SBProfile sense.
Right.  "Analytic" in the SBProfile sense just means that it can directly return the value without using the full 2-d fft.  So a lookup table counts.
those things are moved over  RESOLVED
Good point.  This function isn't that much of a tall pole (using the lookup table is the more common code path), but that's a good change to make nonetheless.  I'll do that.
It is square.  Seems like the better thing to do, since this isn't a radial profile, so the square region is I think the more relevant thing to do.  But you're right that the debugging statement (which I probably just copied from another profile's corresp
I'm not sure that `group="optional"` is going to work here.  We need to set one size for each component.  Don't we need to tell the config framework that somehow?  So isn't "optional" saying the wrong thing?
What exactly is being tested wrt self.axes?  Being None?  Being of length greater than zero.  I know PEP8 encourages this sort of semantics, but it is a pain in the butt to me to understand the intention.
On my box - I already had Git in the PATH for my user - might have been set up by either Chocolatey or msysgit. I'm pretty sure this should be kosher.
PS: VoxelBorder DOES allow TeleportCause.ENDER_PEARL  and internally disables the use of EnderPearl for teleportation
I was just following the Riak way, but yeah I'm not the biggest fan of it either.   I can remove it.
The curly brace in our Scala code is usually at the end of the previous line. Maybe the code could be formatted better.  (I had to read the documentation of foldLeft to be sure...)
unless config[:user].nil? || config[:password].nil?
Instead of a try/catch here, why not disable the editing functions when the view model states that the selected document is not editing?   ie: Bind the IsEnabled property of the controls to SelectedDocument.IsEditing
It needs to be one z-index higher than lockscreen-main-panel. Don't know how to give a relative z-index.
I couldn't find a pattern, but it wasn't a matter of unloading apps with sticky dirs like kernel.  It can happen for any of the Riak dependency apps.
You copied this pattern around 4 times. Any chance you could extract it into a method?
we should cap it with strndup
Ok. I thought include was a control (it's always called as a function, so where do we draw that line).
I started not being a very big fan of RowVector and ColumnVector be different classes from Matrix.
Needs platforms and since tags
It's not. I just thought that adding the strictness would be a nice thing to do.
Needs since tag
`include` is considered a "language construct" not a control structure. So I think we're ok there to treat it as a function, as that is how it is being used in this form.
Switching to `switch` is good thing in this case. But this: ```objc case CPAfterCheckinActionNewUpdate: case CPAfterCheckinActionNewQuestion:     ... ``` and this ```objc (self.afterCheckinAction == CPAfterCheckinActionNewUpdate) ? CPPostTypeUpdate : CPPo
Either way, i removed the unloading bit. Not having it doesn't seem to affect any of our existing tests.
Oh ok, that makes sense.
Should there be a "break" ?
%{timestamp} means the 'timestamp' field (in @fields of the event), I think this may be better written as "%{@timestamp}" though perhaps as long as this special case is documented as such it's fine. 
Make message consistent with what we typically do ``` Assert.notNull(factory, "'factory' must not be null"); ```
No, replies work fine with lastId concept.
LastId is used in ordering the feed (addPostsFromArray: postsArray: in CPVenueFeed). 
I understand that they work fine, was suggesting that both be the same for consistency. Guess we can't take lastID out of api call anyways since web uses that now.
Could I kindly ask you to edit the document as you see fit. Unfortunately, I do not understand your suggestions for improvement. I think you only have to edit a couple lines. Thank you very for much for your assistance. ;-) Jonathan On Aug 9, 2012 7:3
You don't have to change it, but in C/C++/ObjC is good practice to use this: `if (0 == self.selectedIndex) ...`. It will prevent this kind of bugs `if (self.selectedIndex = 0) ...`. It will save you a lot of time debugging. ;)
Don't ignore inline nodes -- iterate over them, just like in getScanNodeList_recurse . (Don't forget to remove the comment)
it might be a good idea to also unregister the signal handler just before db_close() is called later in main()
This will have a global effect on the tests and will need to be undone at the end of execution. Perhaps:   ``` try:     mpl.rc_file(fname)     assert mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] == 33 finally:     linewidth = mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] ```
I think it would be better to rename this file to something like ```test_rcparams.rc```.  Additionally, it might be worth mentioning inside the file that this is only used in the ```test_rcparams.py``` tests.
This file needs to be added to ```matplotlib/__init__.py``` for automatic test pickup (see http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/devel/coding_guide.html#creating-a-new-module-in-matplotlib-tests)
This line is fine, but I don't believe the ```abspath``` is necessary. Normally:   ``` os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'mpl.rc') ``` Would suffice.
Are multiple plots with the same range supported here too?
Put an empty line under all your header lines.
No. I am not able to differentiate between tuple of expressions and tuple of ranges as both are of length 3.
I think `...` should be replaced with `**kwargs`.
What exactly is this doing here?  Leftover debugging code?
At first I wanted to do regexp as key, mode as value but it is not possible.  if we want someday, multiple regexp for one mode (who knows ?)  the only way I saw was list of regexp.  
I understand why you're using the MoveEventSucks class. In fact, I switched instaPort to use it as well. I switched TeleportCause.ENDER_PEARL for TeleportCause.PLUGIN because it seemed a better fit, that's all.
It is usefull for raw cell, where you can start on `diff --git`. End, I'm not sure.  
I see your point and tend to agree. Names are but sound and smoke. I'll change it!
Again, should be in a separate pull-request.

@fabpot So the message keys are fine? The way @vicb described it was exactly the idea.
See #892.
Thrift uses $GLOBALS to store the path to the thrift folder
I tend to use `foo.must_be :blank?` for stuff like this. MiniTest::Spec will take any symbol with a `?` at the end and call that method on it and use the symbol for pretty error messages. So good things like `:valid?`, `:present?`, etc are all possible.
Yes.  Good catch.  I'll add that documentation.
There's a double space here :P
