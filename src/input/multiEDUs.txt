Have a look at . I've tried to get my "MSN Invite contacts" function working right now and that's what I've found this far. Works excellent!
Um... Nothing... Sad that we all missed the simple solution.
Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.
Anyone??? I'm starting to hate VS for that reason!
In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.
tabby cat fun and easy you can sing and make music your own way. :)
is a really great option for git . Most of the free , public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license ( and , possibly , your documentation ) . That ' s potentially a different thing that you ' re talking about ( backups ) . For just backups , you may want to try a for - pay service or even something like . 
I have two tables which looks this : Each news can only have one tag . What is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table ? The Tags table has 50 000 rows . I ' m only doing bulk inserts of approx . 300 news at a time , around 2 times per hour . I assume that i need some in - memory cache for the tags ? If the tag is not in the tags table , i need to insert it and set TagID to the newly inserted id . Hope you ' ll get the idea ! 
I am referring to this behaviour: (Windows doesn't include the mouse cursor in the screen shot, I'm hovered on the uppermost (+) here.) I find this incredibly annoying in some cases, especially with larger methods. In , I have both checkboxes blank.
I ' ve used a few times in the past , and clients really liked it . It ' s not AJAX , as it loads all the full sized images on page load , but if you were motivated I ' m sure you could make that change pretty easily . 
I would recommend -- it's an excellent CMS with great built-in translation.
Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
My current result when I do a test run in main is.
I'm not sure I follow what you mean by "service layer"... "service" is such an abused generic term these days :-(
This might help you understand/explore things a little bit more. An excellent article! Cheers!

Great question! There have already been a few questions that address A few:
To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.
Sorry, attached the file to the wrong issue.
My bad, forgot to include the test file in the patch... Resubmitting in a second. 
This is a great question .. my approach for solving this question would be to ask : Given a list of items , what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted . As the list becomes more sorted , the probability will approach 100 % . To calculate this probability is relatively simple : I hope this helps ! 
I had heinous problems with this until I disabled my Norton Autoprotect anti-virus software. SO posting tip: include version, OS, etc. of your environment.
Right, since you recognize EAV, I'm supposing you'll do fine :3 Good luck!
I host a project on CodePlex, but a bunch (200+) files need to have their extension changed. What is the easiest, least painful way to do this? I cant see myself doing them one by one in the IDE. Update: I know I can just remove and change them via the commandline/utility, and readd them, but that would lose history. Perhaps there is some commandline interface to TFS on CodePlex?
I ' m trying to debug my application and from the point I fire it up on the iPad , it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches FinishedLaunching ( ) ( I have abreakpoint there ) ! Here ' swhat I see in the output panel . All this takes almost 20s . If I run the app in RELEASE build it randomly gets stuck . I hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later . What is going on ? In the Simulator it is all okay . 
There is a solution to your problem.
For what it's worth, NSCollectionView does this too (you can see it in action in the IconCollection sample code). They apparently wait for a "quiet period" in which you've stopped dragging. I've been trying to write a similar class, and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize.
ok i have tried this with NEO4J but not with great success! any tools suggestions ?
What tool are you using to create your report?
I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.
needs bug fix since update love this game but since the update ot freezes up and or shuts down and you lose lives. not good! fix the bug please. and ill fix my rating =)
The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.
You hate the price. Fair enough. ;)
Acropolis was killed as a standalone product , with its contributions being cherry - picked for later libraries such as MEF or whatever the WPF version of CAB is called . 
Never knew about VS macros. It's awesome!!! Just what I need in a couple scenarios. Thanks a lot
Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
Well, without any third-party tools, I'd say try using the clipboard ring, but roosteronacid's idea about the snippet is probably quicker. Hope that helps!
Thanks for the answers. I've found a great sitemap generator over at codeplex. If anyone is interested you can check it out here: Enjoy!

I have a silverlight control (View) which displays a list of items in a specified property of the datacontext (viewmodel). What I need is for the scrollviewer in my control to scroll to the top or bottom depending on where the latest item has been added to the list. (It'll always be either the beginning or the end of the list, I don't need to worry about middle of list insertions.) In WPF i'd just use the DataContextChanged event to start listening to the viewmodel, but in silverlight that event is internal. Any ideas on how to tackle this?
NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.
this is an old question - why hasn't 'steve m' picked an answer yet?
In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?
I have just come across this great API : However , I would like to also retrieve the continent . Is this even possible as I can not find it . Maybe there is another API that is freely available that will offer city , country and continent ? I have tried Googles AJAX API but they don ' t offer continent either . Maybe I going to have to just convert what I already have into continents , how ? ! I hope this isn ' t too subjective ! Thanks all 
When you find yourself doing this, you need to ask yourself if this is the intended way of getting your server started. You shouldn't worry about this and make sure your python and django paths are set correctly. This is ignoring the actual problem.

In VB.NET you can, with the keyword (I believe). But what you're trying to do seems really horrible. Just set them explicitly. It's almost exactly the same amount of code.

I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
awesome explanation!! this is seriously awesome..

This is probably silly but very frustrating . Using VS2008 with a C + + project , when I ' m working normally , the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I ' m debugging it disappears and can ' t be shown . This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running . Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn ' t do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl + Alt + B Does this happen to anybody else ? It ' s a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions . same configuration with VS2005 doesn ' t have any problems . 
Couldn't agree more about TextPad being an excellent editor (my personal favourite). However, whilst it does search over multiple files (and very quickly at that) it doesn't do search and replace over multiple files.
I have no answer, but I'll 2nd the sentiment about the documentation quality for OpenSSL... I'm working with it now also (just starting), and it's horrible trying to find examples or documents for anything beyond simple operations... I feel your pain.
Why would you do that? You're begging for horrible debugging sessions!
I have a table that is referenced by a ton of other tables via foreign keys. I am trying to delete a Document record, and according to my execution plan, SQL Server is doing a clustered index scan on every one of the referencing tables. This is very painful. I thought having a FK automatically made an index on the FK fields? Or am I wrong? Do I really have to go around my database putting an explicit index on every single FK field?
? so far so good. ? however  freezes up way too much. hope that error gets fixed soon or i will have to give it the boot.
I finally managed to get it to work.

I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs, no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?
I had to do this once in Notes for a plugin I was developing. What I ended up doing was editing the Notes template in the designer, and then writing some LotusScript behind it that called a .NET class via a DLL. So when you clicked the button, it triggered the event in the LotusScript, and then called the DLL, and passed the item information to it. I should also note that it was a freakin' bear to figure out because Notes documentation is terrible.
I'm using bootstrap modals to display a iframe all works well, but in ios 7 safari (ipad) the user can not type any text in any of the text boxes (the keyboard simply doesnt open, nor does it focus) or are they able to click any links, yet it displays on the screen absolutely fine! and outside of the iframe the site continues to function. has anybody else run into this? cheers
I hate to say it, but constant polling over HTTP is the poor mans solution.
Just to add more - JavaScriptSerializer and DataContractJsonSerializer aren't always compatible with each-other (DateTime, IIRC, is a pain).

@Guffa: a *very* excellent question. There's not typically a good reason to do so.
I really hate Jquery , your code looks as if you are looking forward to publishing your project finalized with Jquery .. Anyhow .. if your looking to replace the jquery selector $ ( " " ) with a function you should know that the function requires that it returns a DOM element . otherwise an error will be flagged and java script with abort . 
Another good reason is relative longevity . db40 is an excellent product for what it does , but its user base is small and it isn ' t likely to outlive something SQL Server . Of course , I also used to say there was no way Java was going to survive . 
I ended up using , which met all my needs and is (IMO) very excellent.
Loved all 3 responses ! I picked Gordon ' s because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter ( I didn ' t ask for this but I was able to implement that later ) . JBrooks solution was great because it had a smaller footprint and allowed me to leverage functions , and shree ' s one was a little too verbose for my bigger project but still did exactly what I needed . Thank you all ! 
Excellent questions ! This particular project will need DS , WAYF , etc . 
In ASP.NET MVC, I have a form. In this form the user selects a country, and then the ID is posted back to the server, using a normal . However, for some UX reasons, I use Knockout. Therefore I need to get my observable value to have the value of a dropdownlist. I want my label in the markup, to show the countryId, depending on the selected value on the dropdownlist. Markup: ViewModel: Then my question is: How do I modify my DropDownListFor, so the countryId is being set automatically? :-) Thanks a lot! I really enjoy learning Knockout, but this one has taken me a long time!
It ' s a progress bar ! : ) Setting makes it a rotating circle rather than a classic progress bar . There are several different styles you can use . Play around with them to find the one you like : ) Hope this helps ! 
ISpellChecker is an interface, not a defined class. Therefore any class implementing that interface can be 'injected' into TextEditor. Whoever creates TextEditor can determine what implementation of ISpellChecker it uses. And this answer describes Dependency Injection, nothing to do with IoC.

i am working on iphone app, at once it started showing me error, with no exception, i am really afraid of this error, can any one tell me why this is happening?
I am new to .NET in general, so I hope this isn't too n00b of a question. I'm looking to write a Silverlight app that interacts with a MSSQL DB using LINQ. Do I absolutely, positively have to use a seperate WCF service? It seems there are security implications, but this would be on a completely trusted network. Thanks in advance
@PhilipOakley excellent suggestion! I hadn't used `cherry-pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I'll accept.
@MrChrister : The actualOrderNumber is relied on by multiple legacy app. Changing it would be extremely problematic. The end-user-visible order number is also used in several apps; adding a new field is do-able but hard. An obscuring "format" outside the persistence layer is TSTTCPW (I think).
Is it possible ( or desirable ? ! ) to set up to behave more ? For example , instead of writing why can ' t I just write Similarly , instead of why not just 
Because, we don't care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down.
One example is if you provide a custom in . Obviously calling wrong will likely produce devastating results . 
No worries, just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase!
Ah, excellent! :)
@DonQuestion Yep. My account is domain admin so it should be ok... really annoying problem! arg

widget locks up my galaxy s3 this a very beautiful looking app and i like it a lot but it regularly locks up the homescreen widget  the clock freezes and the weather status locks up with the status "locating". my phone is a samsung galaxy s3 running on 4.1.1 based in the uk. hope this info helps solve the issue as this app is definitely worth a full 5 stars if it were not for it locking up. please fix this and i'll even purchase the add free pro version ;-)
Notably, the debugger shows the string *with* escape characters. When the string is printed in the console, the escape characters are not included. "\"code\"" vs. "code". This 100 character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying, say, a long JSON string and then immediately pasting that string (escape characters included) as a test string variable in your code.
for debugging purpose in a somewhat closed system, I have to output text in a file. Does anyone knows of a tool that runs on windows ( console based or not ) that detects changes to a file and outputs them in real-time ?
Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.
The last thing you should be worrying about is how fast one of these is. There is no way that checking a string for being an integer is going to be a bottleneck in your code.
And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place, it is only seldom noticed (or when it is, it is blamed on Microsoft.
That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.
Aha,, thanks for the information. That makes sense. Glad to hear that it helped! :)
That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.
I swear - I don ' t put pseudo code I get told off for having bad variable names and things that don ' t match ... I put pseudocode and I still get grief ! 
not so grand the features are great if they work  which unfortunately is nearly never. constantly loses connection to the server when i'm on stable wifi  crashes continuously  doesn't keep up the stream to chat and doesn't like to load lootables at all. this app hasn't been updated in over a year and it's easy to see the lack of support.
Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.
awesome connectivity but freezes! freezes constantly on my s3. i'm pretty upset i just paid. $5 and cant even play out of fear of freezing/losing all progress. i'd really appreciate it if tge devs would try to fix it
You should really take a look at sprox ( ). It builds on RESTController, is very straight forward, well documented (imo), generates forms and validation "magically" from your database and leaves you with a minimum of code to write. I really enjoy working with it. Hope that helps you :)
I added an example of how to use the wrapText function. Good luck with your project!
well, without binding I only managed with: it redraws everything...
I am designing a contact form which has a 'Thank you' message pop up on send, I need my thank you message to be positioned relative, other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation. However positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads, what I need is a way to have the div display:none or opacity:0 BEFORE the send button is pressed, is that possible? Here is an to explain what I'm trying to achieve a little better And below is the Javascript I'm using Any help would be really appreciated :) Thanks guys!
I don ' t think it ' s a matter of which language is better . In the . NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide . There are certain functionality that is available in VB . NET that you might like to use from C # but can ' t . I remember I had to use J # to use some ZIP libraries that were not available in any other language in . NET . 
I have never parsed ini files, so I can't be too specific on this issue. But i have one advice: Don't reinvent the wheel as long as an existing one meets your requirements Good luck :)
@awied: you also need to worry about the situation in which a user accessibility application is driving your program.
in our continuous integration setup we use SVNRevisionLabeller and pass the variables from this to MSBuild to use when creating the compiled website dll. It's then available to .NET using GetCurrentAssembly() in the final build.
Since I've been working with the built-in Microsoft Charting Controls in .NET 4.0 lately (and loving every minute of it!), I thought I'd take a crack at answering my own question...

I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.
Very useful question and an excellent answer ! Thanks
If I use a nvarchar(n) column as a clustered index on a SQL Server database, am I going to suffer a significant performance hit compared to a numeric (int) index? Also how does the performance of compound indexes compare?
Ok , here ' s one way of doing this , but it ' s terrible ! I ' m still looking for an easier way : 
In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.
I ' ve been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model , builds and outputs a view . I think this is mainly wrong . The Controller should act and retrieve / update objects inside the Model , select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display . Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables / simple if statements should appear inside the View . If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model , surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic . 
How do I consume a key event in javascript, so that it doesn't propagate?
There ' s always the poor man ' s alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as . gif / jpg / png and having javascript display them in sequence . It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage , and of course no audio , but it would ( somewhat ) simulate video being played . Of course , on Windows platforms , you could use ActiveX and / or embed media player and play avi / wmv files as well , without ever touching flash . 
That ' s what I was thinking , but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure . I will need to add " Set children " field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code , only for hibernate cascade deletion . Do you think it is ok ? 
Don't rely on Lucene to strip them, do it yourself.
The problem is exact what mysql is telling you : you have too much data for one table. Not only the number of fields are counting towards them, but also their size.. But the real problem is in your database design, you have designed a table that is crying out for help : 'split me up, split me up!' You should your design ..
airplane mode :/ i know you can't do anything about it  but the lack of airplane mode scheduling in kitkat just sucks. other features are very useful.
RegEx is a horrible option for performing replaces on a large amount of text. As powerful as it is, many RegEx proponents see all the world as a nail and RegEx as their hammer. For use cases involving large amounts of text, look at FastReplacer http://stackoverflow.com/a/11442008/141172

I doubt that you will find that much help , considering this is a technique usually reserved for malicious usage ( bots , etc ) . 
I think it's time to just close this issue.
Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).
Wow, it works! Thanks.
Same server, i'm using phpMyAdmin and its being a pain saying i'm not using it the right context!?
You shouldn't rewrite history (rebase) after you've already pushed. If someone else pulls from that remote, and you rebase and push, you'll have terrible terrible merge conflicts.
At a guess , you ' re probably defining your objects in VB as just s , something this : If so , you ' re forcing VB to go through the automation interface ( IDispatch ) . Basically , it doesn ' t know what type you ' re going to assign to until run - time , so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch : : Invoke . To do that , it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time . By contrast , your C + + code is probably early - bound , which means offsets into the COM object ' s vtable are compiled directly into your code . In that case , when / if you change the code so those offsets aren ' t valid any more , the code will fail horribly . 
Try to use the System.DateTime class.
You forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic. Better spare the tester this tedious stuff, so he can concentrate on the nasty testing.
If someone is commonly needing to delete all but the top n rows, I'd argue they've got bigger issues to worry about.

It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.

I'm not familiar with Seam specifically, but I've seen this same problem come up when working with XSLT and other XML-based frameworks. There are generally two solutions: Rethink your page and data architecture so that the entire list written depending on a single condition. This may require a loop inside the s:fragment. Wrap the offending non-valid fragment html in a <![CDATA[ ... ]]>
Your library should be named , with symlinks of and both pointing to that. The library should be created using in the linker command line (or on the gcc command line). Hope that helps!
If you need portable Python audio library try . It certainly has a mac port. As for mp3 files: it's certainly doable in "raw" Python, only I'm afraid you'd have to code everything yourself :). If you can afford some external library I've found some here.
If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.
Excellent! On a Mac as well... I'll look into railsapi.com. Thank you for your help!
It's very painful to add multiple tickets to Trac or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!
No, they've stopped working again and gone back to the 403 forbidden message. Incredibly annoying.
No , the output is not the same ; one is a Unicode value , the other an undecoded bytes value . For ASCII , that looks the same , but when you load any web page that uses characters outside the ASCII characterset , the difference will be much clearer . Take UTF - 8 encoded data , for example : That ' s a simple U + 2013 EN DASH character . The bytes representation shows the 3 bytes UTF - 8 uses to encode the codepoint . You really want to read up on Unicode vs . encoded data here , I recommend : The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely , Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets ( No Excuses ! ) by Joel SpolskyThe Python Unicode HOWTOPragmatic Unicode by Ned Batchelder 
You can try out , it allow prototyping with different styles, what's more, it can make interactive prototype and run it in browser.
You could use an incredibly ugly workaround and set a form full of hidden fields to submit when you click a link. I really wouldn't recommended it though.
far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one  but i do miss smart glass. they need to make this app enable the voice features  and things like the store should be built-in  not a browser link.
My suggestion is to keep track of whether or not you're showing an error at that choke point. If you have lots of places that are doing it, you'd need to synchronize them somehow, e.g. delegate to a singleton object that is responsible for displaying the UI, or use a mutex or something.
this api stinks, it is terribly designed and has lots of bugs!
That would be very awesome , thanks ! If you do post it I will likely contribute ... 
Look the documentation of InputStream #read ( byte [ ] b ).
Excellent!!! This is exactly what I am looking for!
I too am using ideas from Rob ' s pattern and for now am updating Pure . Krome . But i think concurrency is too vital to ignore and should be a habit of any enterprise application developer . I ' m ignoring it for now , but it will go in my later iterations . I would really love to see how your approach turns out David . 
great apps works well and looks great. lots of available providers. from the 5 or so apps i've tested  deliveries seems to support the most.  i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn't working as expected. the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue.   only feature i would like is auto-detection of provider based on the tracking number. but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature  so this doesn't affect my rating.
I see that over on this question there is a request to say how to do something using LINQ to see if a property matches in a collection . However , is this the fastest reasonable process by which to do this ? I will be deploying something that requires a certain amount of resource management , and I want the application to be as responsive as can be , without making the code terribly hard to decipher when someone else , or myself come back to it later . 
Have you considered overriding the administrative templates for the models in question? This provides an excellent overview of the process. In this particular situation, having a finer-grained level of control may be the best way to achieve the desired result.
We have a watchguard appliance at work and I'm able to connect to it using just the standard VPN client that's available under linux through NetworkManager (left click on NetworkManager -> VPN Connections -> Configure VPN)

How to set the default proxy for Internet Explorer in C# .net? I wanna make a browser capable of searching for a valid proxy in a .txt file and using it. The IP and Port used with the set default proxy command are valid however, the command itself does absolutely nothing. The only way I've found to use a proxy with a VS2013 .net browser is by adding it manually to IE which is incredibly useless.
so it comes with the server.
No buddy , You can ' t simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2 . In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed . So , If you really need to move then 1 . Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely . 2 . Install ZF2 package . 3 . Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2 . However , I would suggest don ' t migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading , migrate only if you dont have any other choice . As this is a very painful task . have a good luck .

I have a video player that loads progressive flv video from a server and applies a reflection to it. I do this by creating a bitmapData object and then drawing the video to it. This worked absolutely fine until we moved our content from testing server to Amazon S3. Now there is no reflection. Can anyone explain why this is happening and even suggest a solution? p.s. i am using Flash 8 AS2. thanks

How large is the file? Can it fit in memory?
excellent app for galaxy s4 the major lack (to me) on my gs4 is that the home screen will not rotate to landscape mode. this app resolves the problem.  i have a feature request: the app has to be manually started each time the phone restarts  then the setting has to be selected  then the "close" button selected.   an autostart option with a selectable default mode would make this the ideal app.
Strings containing XML is an extremely bad idea and asking for trouble . Use messages that have a defined schema . I had to rewrite significant portions of an app that used a lot of XML internally instead of types . It was horribly slow and impossible to figure out what was happening .

When using sIFR on the titles (.content h1.pagetitle) in my WP theme, it somehow messes up the spacing and pushes the title down. The actual flash video is the same size as the font, so I think it has something to do with CSS, though I've tried just about everything I could think of and can't get it lined up properly. Here's a link to the site: Any help would be absolutely appreciated :) Sean

@NathanSmith Great success! If you submit that as an answer instead of a comment, I'll accept it!
Dave, very nice!! I didn't know that was in there. Now that I know what to look for, I was able to find an article with a small code sample on how to use it: On a related note, I also found the that looks extremely easy to use.

Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on 'else' keyword when working with PHP source editor in Aptana? As I really, really hate it with this keyword, because after newest release it's really messing with my workflow as after entering 'else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I don't want to disable content assist completely, I just want to disable it for 'else' keyword.
@ Styxxy , It looks the GPMC is explicitly designed for AD GPO ' s and / or doesn ' t support modifying GPO values , and the process for tracking registry values doesn ' t seem to apply to many of the Local GP ' s that can be modified in the gpedit . msc interface ( procmon shows no registry changes while making the change ) .

In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.
It's very painful to add multiple tickets to Trac or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
Why do you need to have the encryption of the passphrase reversible? That's not generally desirable.
I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.

Great, excellent links. Thanks for the help!
Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.

The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.
My application has a frame that is loaded/navigated when certain top-level buttons are clicked. The problem is, one of the hosted pages has a frame of it's own, and is messing with the outer frame's navigation bar (clicking back and forward navigates the inner frame, as well as the outer frame). Is there any way to have the outer frame's navigation control only worry about its immediate contents?
So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.

This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?

I have a Java application that's very String-heavy - it takes a feed of huge numbers of big, different String objects. Do I need to worry about the String Constant Pool for memory and performance? Is there any way to see how big the pool is at any point?
the question just came to me from a different team . The question was " how to query the users in the exchange server ' s particular User group " . Its said that the Exchange server user group is not linked to an Ad group . The examples i could get are all for querying based on AD group . I heard there are two ways either through SQL or through DirectoryServices . Either solution is fine , but through DirectoryServices will be super awesome ! Thanks again !

Do you have any JNI in your application code? Then maybe you need to worry about 32 vs. 64 bit native binaries. 32 or 64 is all the same to your Java code. The performance aspects already seem well covered by previous posters.
I recommend juanagui's answer as it deals with pasting in non-numeric data http://stackoverflow.com/a/2673131/755404
I have run into this too . It is very annoying ! Here ' s why it might be happening . The width of your li items , plus any margins is more than the width of # maincontainer . That means the last li item spills over # maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in , leaving an extra click . One way to check this : assign an id to the last li , and make the width less , and see if that doesn ' t fix it . If so you need to make the # maincontainer wider . 
I mean when the form is posted.

wow the reaction time on this by you guys was amazing xD I'll give everyone +1 once I get to the 15 rep ^_^ Thank you so much everyone!
To be honest I don ' t even know where to start . I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements . I ' m fairly new to this I ' m afraid !

I know its possible to convert an image to CS_GRAY using however, this is a chokepoint of my entire program. I need to do this often, on 800x600 pixel images and takes about 200-300ms for this operation to complete, on average. I know I can do this alot faster by using one for loop to loop through the image data and set it right away. The code above on the other hand constructs a brand new 800x600 BufferedImage that is gray scale. I would rather just transform the image I pass in. Does any one know how to do this with a for loop and given that the image is RGB color space?
In our eternal quest to integrate Javascript into our RSpec and Cucumber workflow we're evaluating and are provisionally very excited about it. Any advice on Culerity in general or specifically as compared to Selenium?

I've been having a spam problem on my site, where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy IP ban them, except they always come back under a different IP address through a proxy or TOR. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the IP and determine if its a genuine user, or someone behind a proxy, in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.
So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.
I have hit this too. No solution as yet. This is very worrying though!

Is there any way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character? It is really annoying in multi-line strings such as SQL statements, and especially LINQ queries. Beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line (nothing lines up anymore) you can't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement. Examples of my daily personal hell.
I should have been very careful before doing this.
This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).
Maybe the answers might just be more insightful if I remove the limitations ... I can ' t just " take the time " since there are a finite number of hours on this contract . Almost the entire code needs to be refactored . I am trying to identify the areas that will reduce the immediate pain .

@grieve Marshalled python objects are tied to a specific version of Python (from [the marshal docs](http://docs.python.org/2/library/marshal.html)), but not being tied to a specific version of Perforce is definitely a bonus to using the command line.
I running an exe from a .NET app and trying to redirect standard out to a streamreader. The problem is that when I do myprocess.exe >> out.txt out.txt is close to 14mb. When I do the command line version it is very fast but when I run the process from my csharp app it is excruciatingly slow because I believe the default streamreader flushes every 4096 bytes. Is there a way to change the default stream reader for the Process object?
I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
There are some really great answers here that I wholeheartedly agree with!
I guess that works , but I ' d never do that . It ' s screaming bad practice . Think about code readability etc .. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup .

How can I get my Error, Logcat, Debug, etc. tabs to go back to the bottom-middle of Eclipse? For some reason, they moved up between the Package Explorer and the code editor in a vertical arrangement - I really hate it when sections of an IDE break off and dock to some seemingly arbitrary area.

Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.
This is the old syntax that is now deprecated. BACKUP LOG is the preferred method.
I found the answer! It appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens. Like most people, we have a database that stores the device tokens, and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing. As soon as I net out those device tokens from my list, all works! I really hope someone finds this useful!
Not sure what you mean by "child form". Perhaps it's a button on a panel on a form? Or is it a MDI thing? Or is the child form a dialog box?

Hi I am developing an android app a musicplayer.It works well except when you hit back key of your phone. It keeps playing song in back ground which is very desirable,but when you open the application again to pause or stop it does not works . I guess a new instance of the application is created on opening the app again. I dont want to create a new instance i want to open the older one to stop it.I hope i am clear.Is there any way to do this.
You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.

I exchanged emails with Marc-AndrÃ© Cournoyer of about supporting Delphi on his site. Since his site uses to do syntax highlighting, and it uses syntaxes, he needs a Delphi syntax for TextMate. Turns out it has a already, so it is 90% of the way there. Does anyone know where I might find one that has already been updated for Delphi? A Delphi Prism / Oxygene one would be great too!
I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query, and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.
You can try the (very) comprehensive jeff's OR go with this simple workaround: And then declare the attribute as an integer: This worked very fine for me! =D

EXCELLENT ! works magic , just what i needed 
has a good website intro to sql. If anyone wants a book, the first several chapters of book are an excellent intro. Much better than the text book from my database class. If anyone wants to explore relational database concepts, seems to have a good intro. book is also very good on that subject.

We eventually dropped using Filestream. I believe we never could get it to work right with Nhibernate. Good luck!
Cool, will do!  Thanks for the review and good questions... and the whole idea! :)
I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from microsoft (~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near 0 so people think it is broken).
It's not efficient, and it assumes PowerShell 2 but it should do the job: Note that I don't have SharePoint installed so I'm afraid that I can't test this!
Get Updated. Not that I'm that a Java Fan, but I'm working now with a Java Team and they do deserve the respect :) See comment by SztupY

Ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later , this is an awful answer , and that is why it is voted down . Why will you only see a small speedup ? Can you provide numbers ? Platforms tested on ? This answer is even more vague than the original question , which was vague to begin with . 
great small file size simple and gets the job done
Sharepoint recognize file types using their extensions. If you are worried about users spreading malicious application/code in your Sharepoint Sites. I suggest you to take a look at . You can modify the excluded extension list under Central Administration > Operations > Blocked File Types.
struct.unpack() returns a tuple. That is why there is a comma at the end of the float. To get the float out of there just ask for the index.
Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.

If you're using a general-purpose method which has the signature that's called from any event handler and is passed both the and , it can call , e.g., for logging events, without worrying about a null pointer exception.
Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.
Excellent method for minor changes. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.
I am using NHibernate mapping-by-code to map the classes. Sometimes, in order to debug my NHibernate configuration, I would require to check exactly what were the settings passed over to NHibernate, and it is quite difficult do debug the mapping-by-code. Is there any way where you could convert the generated HbmMapping, back into the Xml file, just as if typed by hand? This would help a lot in diagnosing if the problem is lying from my mappings!
Ugh, implicit joins! I want to tear my eyeballs out looking at that.
I'm writing a simple app that's going to have a tiny form sitting in one corner of the screen, updating itself. I'd really love for that form to be transparent and to have the transparency be user-configurable. Is there any easy way to achieve this?
Won't that be horribly distracting?
Yeah, I know, I just can't figure out where the 'private' is coming from. It's very frustrating!
It could also be a problem if you worried about running out of ID too fast (if you expect LOTS of records), since you're only using 1/10 of the range you have storage for.
To further explain: Apple once had a section in their agreement that specifically listed the allowable programming languages C, C++, Objective-C and Javascript. This was cause for a lot of confusion, doubts and fear. Eventually Apple stopped naming the languages. I know for a fact that even while this was in place, a variety of apps were on the store, being published, or in development that used Lua scripting in some way or another.

I can only help if I can see the full (ie. non-compressed) source code. The code included on the website has been modified (from jqDock v1.6 source) and re-compressed, which makes it extremely difficult (understatement!) to tell what has been changed.

Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.
I don't think that's fair, I never got too deep into WPF but what I did, didn't seem to suffer from these issues (in a lot of ways WPF was a more mature UI technology than HTML). The new javascript-based UIs I think work on a node-style event loop so I don't think the ui thread is even an issue. For all its many many faults, Microsoft does deserve some credit for how its dev tools have evolved.

jQuery chokes on certain JSON keys. I was sending this JSON snippet in PHP: Renaming the 'result' key to something else works. I would guess this is a reserved word collision of some kind, and could be a bug in jQuery (1.4.2).

FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth . Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case . Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems . It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren ' t stable . I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids . Sometimes it just can ' t see the component and it dies . They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group . I would avoid using this .

I have a screen with say 20 controls on it. I want to show all twenty, then hide only the ones that don't relate to what I'm working on. My problem is that between the loops the screen paints.

I ' ve been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model , builds and outputs a view . I think this is mainly wrong . The Controller should act and retrieve / update objects inside the Model , select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display . Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables / simple if statements should appear inside the View . If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model , surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic . 
Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.

i have a cache that uses WeakReferences to the cached objects to make them automatically removed from the cache in case of memory pressure . My problem is that the cached objects are collected very soon after they have been stored in the cache . The cache runs in a 64 - Bit application and in spite of the case that more than 4gig of memory are still available , all the cached objects are collected ( they usually are stored in the G2 - heap at that moment ) . There are no garbage collection induced manually as the process explorer shows . What methods can i apply to make the objects live a litte longer ?

One thought might to have another separate process count the number of rows in the table where the insert is being done to determine what percentage of them are there already.

The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure ( now as a string ) in order to return that as JSON . So you are basically doing a double encode and the " string " gets encoded . So just pass in the data once : So on a small collection this : Yo get a result this : If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson " dumps " to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the Mongo objects deserialized , then further put into your ordered dict . But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements . 
A pleasure :>.

What you are asking is inherently impossible. The game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user's mercy. Only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user's input (mouse movement, keypresses), which is absolutely ridiculous.

I just started practicing TDD in my projects . I ' m developing a project now using php / zend / mysql and phpunit / dbunit for testing . I ' m just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach . My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities . To make it more clear , private and protected functions are not directly testable ( unless you will create a public function to call it ) . So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them . I ' m really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability . Is this the correct way of doing it ?

I first created a new header file , called " MyString , h " and placed it in the header folder . It contains a class called String . you can see the code I used for it at the end of this I also now have a MyStringTest . cpp file in the source files folder . It has the following code in it . Expected : Compiles and runs a console program which will output " llo " Reality : Error : ' Identifier ' String ' is undefined Here is some of my code in the header file ... i really cant fit all of it . .... 
My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
Where exactly do you hook your events inside your UserControl?
I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.
Wow, great! thanks, I didn't know this one existed.
In the future study the input and the output of your systems carefully.

I think the first approach is OK , but you have to be sure to always have branch B updated with the new changes introduced in branch A . Otherwise if you don ' t keep them synchronized , these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain . SVN merge ' s are ok if you do them early and often . 
Here is a solution that works for lower case strings only. Horrible horrible code, but I was trying to see how few lines I could write a solution in.
I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.
@Chris Two different control statements just to appease developers who want their switch statements to work in a slightly different way? That's a **terrible** idea. VB [had that mentality for loops](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Basic/Loops), and it worked out terribly.
In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).
You can add 'priority queue' to the list. It's not in .Net 3.5.
Thanks Nat . The external data is large ( external search results ) so it ' s not possible to keep it as a new list .

Also, it is worth including (in some fashion) the Service Pack downloads as well. In fact, depending on how your executables are built, you might be forced to install the Framework and the Service Packs.

We have a servlet hosted on jboss which works on HttpServletRequest. But sometimes we receieve requests that do not get decoded by jboss, and when we do getQueryParam on HttpServletRequest, we get null. The jboss access log shows the url in encoded form. Normally, when everything works smooth, url is shown decoded in access log. e.g.: This was a problematic request: This was a proper request: Could we be missing some jboss decode settings, or is it just a case of malicious user?
Have you actually implemented this successfully ? It sounds a great solution ! 
Something this ? Bonus . With the switch to you have readline editing capabilities , and tab completion on files . Wooow ! 
Hey , you guys are great , thanks a whole bunch ! I will set up the environment in the cron script .

There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.

For the record, this code is not thread safe without additional locking (which is absolutely fine, thread safety was never part of the design specs for this class).
`ROW_NUMBER()` paging emulation, or SQL Server 2012's `OFFSET .. FETCH` clause can be quite slow for high page numbers: http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/042606-1.shtml. In that case, the [seek method](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19610367/521799) might be a better choice, as it allows for paging in constant time.

I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table . However , my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records .

Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated . -- Anne 
I have to implement gtalk like chat application using UDP FILE_NAME.
Excellent! Thank you so much for the thorough explanation, and for providing the demo. So `eval()` allows you to access the value stored in each variable. This is handy if you want the name of your variable to itself be stored in a variable. Handy! You did an excellent job explaining. Gold star for you. :)

What is the C++ application using? You can always use the same thing or wrap the timer code from C++ into a C++/CLI class.
If the files were never committed and they're no longer on the hard drive, then I'm afraid they're probably gone, unless your user has manual backups, or some other recovery/undeletion strategy works out.
Out of the box , in MS Reporting Services , the image element does not allow for the centering of the image itself , when the dimensions are unknown at design time . In other words , the image ( if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface ) will be anchored to the top left corner , not in the center . My report will know the URL of the image at runtime , and I need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer . 
( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )
Using a unique identifiers would allow you to merge data from two different databases . Maybe you have an application that collects data in multiple database and then " syncs " with a master database at various times in the day . You wouldn ' t have to worry about primary key collisions in this scenario . Or , possibly , you might want to know what a record ' s ID will be before you actually create it . 
Thanks so much for the excellent answers! All answers worked beautifully.

I think using RSA encryption for anything but key transport is abuse. Generate a new key for a symmetric cipher and encrypt your bulk data with that. Then encrypt the key with RSA. Send the symmetrically-encrypted cipher-text along with the asymmetrically-encrypted content encryption key to your recipient.

Sure all code can be made better in the future, if you are up to it. But when I make reusable code, I expect that I can just take it into use later without needing to worry about things.
In elements would receive a unique identifier (a cache key) when required, stored in the property of a node, . . So in I was curious, as I'm in the process of implementing similar logic, how jQuery identify a node in . Referencing a line number in the github repo would be excellent!

Schemas - Okay, 2000 has owners, but they can be a real pain to get permissions right on.
Also, you need to use `$(this)` instead of just `this`
Hate to say it, but I don't think there is a way to alleviate this. I do think that it depends on the client system, though, so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate.
AFAIK there are no native language constructs for this. If you need it for debugging purposes I would advice you to have deeper look into the xdebug extension especially (awesome! :) Another idea would be to implement in your class and wrap all public methods. But this requires to change the code and has other side effects: (simplified example) . Example:

We ended up using a Java applet. It was a nightmare. Normally it would have been awful, but as this was for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the added distance & language differences made it a nightmare. In the end, it worked "enough." But again, nightmare. I would not recommend it.

I've been having this issue for some time and kept just disabling the "Script" tab which is really annoying! I tried to click the pause button so it's flashing and refresh, same issue. Then, click so it's not flashing and refresh, same issue. I just now clicked the pause button (so it was blinking), then un-clicked it so it was not blinking, and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it. The same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error.

I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
is excellent for scripts; is standard for classes. As Ben says, think of it as "Object" -- but it is much cooler in that it does not constrain you to the Object methods. This has neat implications with respect to imports. e.g. In this snippet I have to import FileChannel e.g. But here I can just 'wing it' as long as everything is on the classpath

For the record, while I have seen an implementation where calling on a was O(n), I haven't seen any STL implementations where calling on a was anything other than O(1) -- mainly because s are guaranteed to have random-access iterators. Even so, if you are worried about an inefficient , you can use this code:
I'm apologize for saying this, but the code you've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists, and use String.split to parse a comma-seperated list.
I understand its not a desirable circumstance , however if I NEEDED to have some kind of HTML within JSON tags , e . g . : is this possible to do in Python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand ?

Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters. Expected 1 error on the last remaining bugs in this program. Little background on the db: It has 3 tables (A player table (11 columns), a team table (3 columns), and an Opponent table (6 columns). These are both of the functions and I am fairly certain the problem lies in here somewhere or this function
+1. Great question! Now, I have no clue about the answer, but I'll stay tuned.
This is a solution to a local problem, not an obvious/general purpose System.String operation. A utility class might be in order, but it would be extension method abuse to use an extension method here.

great app love the- my list feature.  i can find the best deals and plan my black friday shopping trip
Nope, I don't think such a magic function exists. One workaround for this would be to put your functions into a static class, and add a magic method to that class (> PHP 5.3 only, I'm afraid): For PHP < 5.3, you could do the same thing, but you would have to instantiate an object and use the magic method.
I've tried several other IDEs (the last one was eclipse) but always come crying back. The thing I end up missing most is homesite's 'tag insight' for all the html tags.

Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.
Yup many hours later I found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a EnableViewState="false" added to it. Sad part is that I know I didn't add that because I didn't even know what it was until craig here mentioned it. Visual Studio must have added it sometime.
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.

I'm rethinking the design of my GUI. I designed a few JFrame with Netbeans automated GUI (yes, I'm lazy, and this generated code is often awful, I know !), but now I want them to be JPanel (actually, to inherit from another class that inherits JPanel). But I had the "setDefaultCloseOperation" modified, so my code is broken : setDefaultCloseOperation is impossible for a JPanel. Since I can't modify the generated code, I was wondering : is there a way to make Netbeans understand I changed my mind, and regenerate the code ?
I have a .net assembly that has a COM+ ServicedCopmonent in it and at the moment I install it into the GAC to get everything working.

I am looking to plot cluster heat maps from gene expression data that I have.
I have two files . File 1 : a FASTA file with gene sequences , formated this example : File 2 : A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene . Like so . Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1 , but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2 . I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2 . I feel there must be something in the biopython module that could help me , I just don ' t know what . For instance , I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function , but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers . I don ' t know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file . Maybe reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence ... But I really don ' t know .... Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated ! 
I'm afraid I don't know any answer other than to start looking around in your area for old hardware. The CPU isn't the only variable that can (usually) affect things. L1/L2 cache size, memory bus speed, memory speed/latency, hard drive speed, etc. are all significant factors in many applications.

I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.
thanks so much! excellent insight!
Only way I could figure out how to do it without just moving the file and telling the user was to pass it off to the browser.

Right, and that code calls which one: phone.dial(phoneNumber) or phoneNumber.dialOn(phone)?
We ' re running into a really painful issue with Honeycomb ' s here , and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution . The problem itself is quite simple : We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service . While these tasks are running , we show the ActionBar ' s refresh spinner and animate it . The problem is : onCreate and onResume are executed before is , so at the point where we start the task , the refresh spinner doesn ' t even exist . Hence , it won ' t animate . I don ' t see any simple way around this . I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate , and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available , update it accordingly . But still , I can ' t believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar ? 
Excellent! This should be marked as an answer. Very good solution.
Great ! I ' m glad you like it . 
How can I call a custom action dll written in managed code (.net) from an installer without using an unmanaged intermediary?
Thanks djuth, this works great and is very simple! I have to admit it is pretty limiting though, for example, I would love to have it autocomplete a staff name and then return a staffID but I can probably play around with what's added and parsed.
Because the ORDER BY RAND() method is terrible for performance. Note that he has 120,000 rows in his table.

I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named userID, not simply id, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!
This is an internal error *in the Python C code*. Something more heinous is going on here, I don't think this is an error in your Python code.

Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.

what is that downvote? it's real and valid question, and I hate DRM too!
on the root window is how xbindkey does it . Be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though , it ' s very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process ... And that ' s why , if it was me , + " echo ' moo ' > / tmp / moo - fifo " would be the way to do it . That way , you could also control it in any number of other ways you haven ' t thought of yet . 
I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.

This is by design - & is usually a desirable outcome ! Linq - to - SQL inserts child objects to preserve relational integrity . If you can turn that off somehow , the next obvious solution is to remove the relationship . This is not an ideal suggestion but it will work . Now A does not have a ClassB object , and hence the Insert statement will not insert your B . 
What can I do to increase the performance/speed of my PHP scripts without installing software on my servers?
If you're running on Windows, you could do something similar using PowerShell. This could be extended pretty easily to find all unversioned and ignored files and delete them. Hope that's helpful to someone!
That doesn't seem to create a table... any reasons why? I tried dbdelta too.
I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux, and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?
How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder, you can easily check the build dependencies, and by testing it within a pbuilder environment, you can check the dependencies.
You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.
My first instinct is to branch normally (using p4 integrate), and then use an IDE or sed script to change the package names. But this makes future integration from the trunk extremely painful.
So, I'm fine with your logic, but given that I don't understand it please don't get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it.
The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.
Excellent question. IMHO this type of thinking makes programs much more robust, especially when they undergo constant change.
I love the way you assimilated another answer!
FWIW, git rebase interactive now has a "reword" option, which makes this much less painful!
Having separate DLL's certainly makes it easier on the developers. We do that here for a set of projects (a set of data filters) with nearly identical I/O requirements, and a common API. Each dev can go off and do his own thing without worrying about builds and conflicts.
I'm using the ImageMapster jQuery plugin, and I want to limit the number of selections that can be made on a (image-) map to a certain number.

If you read the FB . init documentation , there are some parameters that can be used while defining . One of the parameter is which - Determines whether XFBML tags used by social plugins are parsed , and therefore whether the plugins are rendered or not . Defaults to false .

To get your jquery code to work simply define this paramter to true which is false by default - and it shall work . Good luck ! 
Do you happen to know why LINQ doubly nests the actual `SELECT` statement? Is (was?) that a subtle performance tweak for some SQL Server version? I feel that the 2nd level could be merged with the 1st level.

We have a file named wordlist , which contains 1,876 KB worth of alphabetized words , all of which are longer than 4 letters and contain one carriage return between each new two - letter construction ( ab , ac , ad , etc . , words all contain returns between them ) : I want to create a new file that contains only words that are not derivatives of other , smaller words . For example , the wordlist contains the following words [ " abuser , abused , abusers , abuse , abuses , etc . ] The new file that is created should retain only the word " abuse " because it is the " lowest common denominator " ( if you will ) between all those words . Similarly , the word " rodeo " would be removed because it contains the word rode . I tried this implementation : But it always froze my computer . Any solutions ? 
I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.
If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.

As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.

Excellent! You, sir, need a Flattr button. Or join Gittip.
First : I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application . Excellent ! But , as you said : Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself . The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again . This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed . As you can see in your stack trace , FragmentActivity . onCreate is called . This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore . The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context . For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them . 
I'm sorry, but I didn't had an eye on this thread. I'm afraid the topic isn't hot anymore!?

Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments (could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage. (In this case, I'm using postgres).

I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you're not in maven project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/main/java/resources/ .Hope this helps!

Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.
I would avoid it for module globals certainly. For variables restricted to local scope, so you can see the same function isn't ever going to need to use the builtin, it's not something I'd worry about.

This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers
needs work there should be a way to adjust the shape and location of the eyes  cheeks  and lips. everyone's features are not shaped the same. even with a well-lit picture taken at the right angle  your app proves inaccurate. which is highly disappointing  seeing as you are a "big name" cosmetic brand and not some rinky dink developer making a cheap  advertising heavy app for little girls. i expected more from mary kay  and this type of one-size-fits-all lack of attention to detail and diversity  makes you look bad.

if only... i'm using this app on a note 10.1 and have also tried the obvious competition.   there are some features i really like and already miss in other apps  especially the very well implemented blending and the in-depth controls for setting pressure sensitivity. the deal breaker for me  at the moment: noticeably worse brush lag than in other apps. note: there is actually a "note mode" which limits the area to the current tile and is much smoother  but offers only a small selection of tools while active. i'd love to have that kind of performance with the full functionality (within reason when it comes to more demanding / bigger brushes).  short version: love nearly everything about it and will definitely buy the full version when the performance gets improved.

I have a web page that renders the same in IE7, Firefox, and Safari - except when printing. IE7 appears to allocate too much space for borders when printing.

I hate CSS hacks, and so far I've been able to create my pages without them. Any suggestions?
Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.
Great!.. works as advertised - Thanks aku. Voting you closer to the 5K mark :)
I think that ' s absolutely terrible practice . First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls , unless you need new data . Second , any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control ' s id , class name , or whatever css selector . Moreover using a javascript post / get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback . I ' d suggest using JQuery , or some other alternative .

Excellent! @vinay-kr-sharma , but i add some more code to put my month language
Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion , but it ' s a bit overkill for my small ASP . NET MVC web application . I like Lobstrosity ' s idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple ... just what I need . Both are good answers yet one solves the general question ( involving a css framework ) and the other one solves my specific need ... I guess I should select Ryan ' s response as the solution as it would probably help others more ... any suggestions ?

Your question assumes that mail clients follow the RFC standards for MIME encoding, which they don't. I'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as-it-exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.

My NSLog messages no longer show up in my Debug Area. Anyone have an idea how the could have happened? I can hit command-7 to bring of a list of logs in the left pane, select the latest one and view it in my editor window, but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area.

I for checking whether the function exists yet. In summary: Does that work for you? If it does then you can just wrap in a loop. A bit less nasty than a setTimeOut!
I would tend to leave them open -- but open them with the file share permissions set to allow other readers and make sure you flush log output with every message. I hate programs which don't even let you look at the logfile while they are running, or where the log file isn't flushed and lags behind what is happening.

Suggestions that I found were.
My advice is to not even worry about it . HTML and XML , unlike most languages , are almost trivial to re - indent to any style the programmer wants . In HTML I use width - 2 tabs , and regularly have sections that run off the edge of the editor window . There ' s not really any way to avoid that unless you just skip indenting sections of the document . 
You've got to start with a custom instance of . We'd prefer to implement the simpler , but in this scenario we need access to the underlying . Then, to wire it up in the iBATIS config: Hope this helps!

Any decent browser should protect against malicious code in images so I don't think you'll have to worry. If you're truly concerned you can use a combination of getimagesize() and see about using a ClamAV extension/program to scan files for malicious code. Nothing is perfect though.

what if you added a  feature to estimate your calories. when i miss a day (always horrible) the app assumes i ate nothing that day and my weekly nutrition does not include that day. the ability to assume an average of calories based on previous days would be incredibly helpful.
That would be unlikely . It depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts . With managed code you have to recurse 10s of thousands of times in order to break the stack . When the probability of non - uniqueness approaches 10,000 : 1 , then it ' s time to worry .

I tested this code out with an Access 2007 database with no exceptions (I went as high as 13000 inserts). However, what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the "using(connection)" outside the loop, it goes much faster.
I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.

Voting to close, the question I linked back to should have everything you need.
I had figured out the solution. What I realized was happening was that The deployments stopped working period, not just certain files were not coming across. This is absolutely a bug in Azure deployment as near as I can figure. I had to drop & recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work. As a side rant. Microsoft makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors. And they wonder why their market share is shrinking.
... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.
How would you manage the lifecycle and automated build process when some of the projects (C# .csproj projects) are part of the actual build system? Example: A.csproj is a project that uses MSBuild tasks that are implemented in BuildEnv.csproj.

Getting the ssrs add-in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add-in. I ended up un-joining the farm, re-joining it, then installing the component. That got it to work. Then I just had to re-deploy solutions, re-activate features and re-configure my web.config.

None whatsoever :( There are broken pieces of some code fragments here and there, 90% say it's been deprecated, is the a one single page on the internet that gives me a working example how to do that from javascript. Many pages about oAuth, but I have absolutely no idea how to use it , I have spent days reading broken pieces here and there, but I was unable to understand what that it and how I can use it PRACTICALLY. Very sad, and I am very tired to waste so much time on things that dont work and are not documented in human language, possible to understand. Why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken pieces of information everywhere?

Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is "extracts code samples from file". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.
Interesting, I just replaced my src with the latest in the trunk and did a compleatly clean build and the problem seems to have gone away.

If your end goal is to add elements to your page, just manipulate the DOM directly. Don't use string concatenation to try to create HTML - what a pain!

I have a somewhat complicated issue . I have a grid defined ( using the Struts2 - JQuery Grid Plugin ) .

The question was "how important". Answer: it is NOT important at all. If you don't have a dozen servers running this app already, then this is probably early optimization, and as we all know, early optimization is the root of all evil.

@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.

The whole purpose of J# is to ease the transition of Java developers to the .NET environment which didn't work so well (I guessing here) so Microsoft dropped J# from Visual Studio 2008. For your question, "Is there a real benefit of using J#?".. in a nutshell... No..
i am also having this exact problem . large table , nested divs within table . firefox renders teh page within 10 seconds , ie renders the table after a wait of 2 minutes . firefox still zips along with teh drag and dtop , ie crawls .. infact it freezes , and the drag and drop sdoes not work . am going to try some of teh solutions below . the fixed width , and the # id tagname . class references . But i do fear that it will still be slow . if anyone else has some good i deas , I would be all ears . 
Holy (*&^. I just looked at the jquery solution: add a hidden element to the DOM containing every conceivable tag and then reverse engineer the geometry conventions. The web is truly amazing place!
The problem with your code is that you are getting the text of the function in your " template " variable . You still need to that text to create an actual JST instance on the window . The problem as a whole is that you are abusing the text ! plugin , what you really need to do is use the modules of requireJs instead of hanging your variables on the window . 
As a tip: Sorting the whole mess can be very annoying if you had another class structure before. Use CodeMaid, which can do it automatically.
One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.
@ tdiop your users will still hate losing their selection though !

I need to pass a regex substitution as a variable: This, of course, doesn't work. I tried eval'ing the substitution: but that didn't work either. What horribly obvious thing am I missing here?
Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.
Sorry, I tought I could commit this patch but I did not realize that one of the files is in the framework (and I have not access to it).
Dude I feel your pain, same issue here.
I ' ve used the pspell package to do this . Take the search term , check the spelling . If its not OK , PSPELL will make suggestions . You can even run the suggestions though your search , count the results , and then say : Your search for " foo " returned 0 results . Did you mean " baz " ( 12 results ) or " bar " ( 3 result ) . If you are worried about performance , only do this when a search returns 0 results . 
@AndrewLazarus - Excellent point!!
Its really depressing. Ended up with downloading the whole bundle again.
If you decide to use events to drive your swf in order to approximate different frame rates I ' d recommend using a tween engine like . It ' s free ( as in beer ) and I ' ve used it very successfully for frame based tweening in the past . 
Didn't notice the horrid inline jQuery, remove it! Then open the browser console (F12) and check for errors.
You should try Type Hierarchy. Right Click the class and Open Type Hierarchy. There are so many option look for Show all inherited members. It can be found at the lover section of the Type Hierarchy Widget.
CODE_FRAGMENT overrides these methods, so there is no fear that such an Exception will be thrown.
I ' m working on a package which includes rescaling of images in PHP . For image rescaling , PHP has the GD and ImageMagick libraries . Are those likely to be part of a given client ' s PHP install already ? Is there a " default " install of PHP , for that matter ? By default , are either GD or ImageMagick included ? If neither is installed , should I have some sort of horrible fallback position of reading , rescaling , and saving GIFs , JPGs , and PNGs , or is it simple to add GD or ImageMagick to an existing install ? 
No. I cannot seem to be getting the module to work. Its really pain staking.
When I run my client, it throws the following exception.
here's my hack that assumes arguments are all imaginary: ...horrible! but what you ask for isn't really possible without for instance hacking to dispatch to a new subtype of java.lang.Number. Really it would make more sense to use a Java or Clojure complex number library.

I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)? Or, in a simplier words, how can I determine current visible rect of a view?

I can't seem to find the answer to this anywhere... I have a function that needs to set the bg color of two tables. Only the first table in the function is being affected. Is only one for loop allowed in a function? ...or is the 1st for loop maybe never exiting? I can pretty much work around this by creating multiple functions but I really want to understand why this behaves the way it does! Thanks! Here is my simplified code:

It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program ' s design more precise . Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use . Here ' s how : Be warned that it ' s sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs , but this option won ' t hurt much if you ' re just trying to disable a function . By the way , this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it , it ' s now up to you to choose which method will receive this . Hope this was helpful ! 
I think the fact that you have SVN at the moment makes this question less obvious . A managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive . There are many options , and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes . 
I am in need of generating a random string with spaces and mixedCase. is all I got so far: I am getting only uppercase strings with no spaces - I believe the tweak should be pretty striaghtforward to get mixed case and spaces in the soup. Any help greatly appreciated!
It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.

The objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command (or maybe a local script - on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use SSH to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running WinCE which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an SSH server running on WinCE. I looked into the OpenSSH port but it doesn't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using SSH on WinCE. So, any ideas?
What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?
Does string immutability work by statement , or by strings within a statement ? For example , I understand that the following code will allocate two strings on the heap . " hello " will remain on the heap until garbage collected ; and s now references " hello world ! " on the heap . However , how many strings does the following line allocate on the heap ... 1 or 2 ? Also , is there a tool / way to verify the results ?

All the places I've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment, although the production env. has always been some brand of Linux - usually RH or CentOS. I personally use Windows 7 for dev., and I wouldn't use anything else. You spend way less time debugging the OS, and more time coding. This makes management much happier! (PHP developer mostly)
The Adobe example "works" in Firefox 3.0.1 in the sense that the background is transparent. However, in Firefox 3.0.1 and Safari 3.1.2 you must click the play button twice to see the animation.

If I understand this correctly : Current CPU developing companies AMD and Intel have their own API codes ( the assembly language ) as what they see as the 2G language on top of the Machine code ( 1G language ) Would it be possible or desirable ( performance or otherwise ) to have a CPU that would perform IL handling at it ' s core instead of the current API calls ? 
There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.
If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
@ Chris , excellent , I ' m thrilled to hear that you ' re migrating to salted hashes ! : ) 
I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.
Sometimes youre developing and you decide to commit, forgetting you created a few files on your project. Then a few days down the line your buddy gets your build out of subversion and complains that some files appear to be missing. You realize, ah crap, I forgot to add those files! How can I get a list of the files that are not under version control from subversion so I'm sure I've added everything to the repository?
So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.
Seems that it has moved to github: https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp
the way memory handling works in C extension of python has nothing to do with RAII, and is certainly not scope based. I wish it were, though, because as much as I hate C++, RAII is the one thing that makes C++ better than C in this area.
I've knocked up a basic version of what I'm looking for, it's not perfect but it'll do the job until something better comes along.

The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products.
A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply, they manage scale for data - scale that you don't want to deal with. If you have only a few users (hundreds?), you could just as easily manage the data on disk (say XML?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data, or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?
Just that they make you list the type twice. i.e. List list = new ArrayList()
This can probably be done using JavaScript.
I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).
For C / C + + on Windows you have ( at least ) two choices : Use the SerialPort class provided by . NET . Use the Win32 API . There is an dating back to 1995 , and many free libraries and examples on the web to get you started . The . NET option will be much easier .

No `.vimrc` comes first :( and I really hate to modify plugins...
So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.

This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.

There are several articles on the Internet about developing elevated processes in Vista, but essentially elevation requests involve decorating .NET assemblies and WIN32 executables with elevation status in the application manifest file (may be embedded or side-by-side).

What you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see , if the user is logged in is of type student . In the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this : In the . h file create a property for the button that pushes the view so : In the . m file : In the viewWillAppear method of the view do the following check : This way , when the view loads , the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type " Instructor " .

If you just want to test the build , you can suppress the lines concerning ChartFx from the . licx file created by Visual Studio . It should build this way , but probably will not execute correctly , as the license will not be included . The . licx file contains instructions to include binary license resource during build . I ' m afraid that if you want a real build you have to install ChartFx on the build server . 
I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.
@sheidaei great :) keep it up! you even get 2 point bonus for accepting.
I'm looking for experiences with deploying Crystal reports (the basic version, bundled with VS2008) into a production environment. Are there any restrictions? Does it limit the number of concurrent users? Other than downloading and installing the CRRedist2008_x86.msi on the production server, anything to worry about? (And judging from the comments here and other places, yes it would be better to find another solution, but unless there's something free that works with VS2008/IIS6, we're stuck with it for now).
I'm all for option 2. I'd say it's a formatting issue, which is, in my opinion, for the view to worry about.

My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?

How do I stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window? Yes, I abhor pop up windows too. Yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh. I also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh, UNTIL the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh. I have access to the Flash through our Flash developer, but he is uncertain of how to do this. The closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys, yet it does not appear to be working.

Regarding WCF / FTP / WS - Attachment / DIME : Excellent suggestions and some interesting reading . These are probably the types of long term solutions that I will end up using . However if there was some short term solution for changing the upload size in IIS7 that would be excellent . Thanks . 
The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.

This question is still incredibly vague about what you are looking for . I guess your acceptance of an answer , however , lets us reverse engineer the problem .

If you would like to switch to different network operators - The answer is No , you are not able to do that programmatically . There is no API that supports that . If you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is Yes , read post . If you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states - Look . Good luck , hope this helped ! 
Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.
I usualy send all mine to /dev/null that way I don't ever have to worry about it. I have known some people who set it to /bin/logout so that when someone logged in they were logged back out.

CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).
addictive freezes sometimes. annoying having to wait for the lives to recharge
it is being deprecated because it is old and unsafe. switch now or feel the pain later!
But please don't say that my reasoning is bad - because it is not.
running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.

I ' m doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible , I started writing JS functions , webservices etc . to handle all of that ( still long way to go from here ) . Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS . Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions , and is it better to use more update panels or one big ? 
I may have a solution for you: 1. Go into google chrome settings 2. Click advanced settings 3. Click show advanced settings. 4. Under "privacy" click content settings 5.

We've deployed 's Plot Pack in both ActiveX and .Net flavors with great success. Great API, incredibly flexible, provides a toolbar that lets users pan/zoom/customize. It's solid, has a long track record, relatively inexpensive, and is very fast. (I'm not affiliated, by the way.)
Excellent! Your first comment is right on the spot, the other two calls are not necessary. I'll be happy to accept your answer if you create one.
No NUL is written to the file. Just wanted to point out I'd write your line as `fprintf(win, "%smultiscreen=1", bff[i - 2] != '\n' && bff[i - 2] != '\r' ? "\n" : "")`
Is this visual studio specific or all c++ projects behave this way? Why??
This fails miserably when min is INT_MIN and max is INT_MAX. Then max - min + 1 equals 0, resulting in division by zero.
You can do it with BUT, you should look into jQuery, an excellent Javascript library which makes it really easy to do that plus a LOT more! It's worth the small learning curve, trust me.

In my mental model of authentication, a user should be distinct from the way they log in. So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?
It's not a place, but I've found by Charles Petzold excellent. It covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on WPF/silverlight. Of course Petzold (as usual) is able to communicate the important concepts beautifully.

Oh and keep up the great work Alex, I really love were you are going with EF4!
I've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time, I wanted to create an array of arrays (matrix) of BOOL's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings, because apparently NSArray only has arrays of objects. This time, want an array of arrays again, but of CGPoints. I'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?
I tried to download API_NAME file but I am not getting the file on net.
I'd really love this to work in IE. I'm not able to change the fact that tables should not be used here. IE is the only browser the project I'm working on is required to support. Here's the code: I've been using the Tryit Editor to play with this. Thanks in advance for your help!
@Stephen excellent example! Somehow my mind was stuck in 1995 :)

Wow, that was some bad copy/paste work.
great game its an amazing game but 4-1 ie impossible i know how to do it but there is such a small chance of doing it and for 3-7 you flick the battery to the plain box and the on the left side do the colours it said on the right and you do it for the otherside. everytime you get it right you should hear a ding of some sort keep doing that untill the play button comes up toget 3 stars
so far google has no such criteria but better option is enable billing with automatic scaling it really helped me to pace my site ' s speed . if you are really worried on pace increase min idle instance and decrease pending latencies you can find them on your dashboard if your app has billing enabled . 
By the way, I don't know if you found the hover animation binding somewhere and adapted it, or created it yourself, but all the same I really enjoyed it! Quite clever. :]
I'll second the NI Measurement Studio. I've plotted 1000 points/sec with NI Measurement Studio's chart control. Also, this test was done on a laptop with a very lousy video card. AFAIK, Measurement Studio is using OpenGL internally.
I only have one important piece of advice - make absolutely sure you can revert back to the state before you started the refactor without losing anything. Then just dive in and go for it. You may well end up having to stop and start again, but that's nothing to be afraid of (as long as you heeded my one piece of advice). You'll learn a lot doing it.
Now when I load it to the device, an image won't show up. This is all kinds of horrible!

Code Contracts are pretty cool , but they do have some limitations . They will only create compiler warnings , not errors . Also , this analysis is pretty slow on large projects .

Excellent! PHP really is an impressive language.
Indexed lookups in LinkedLists are O(n). That'd could be terrible for a 3d array!
A better, more common practice is to put in the combo box only the items that can be selected. It won't prevent keyboard usage (I, as a user, would find this offensive!) and simplify code.

I agree, we often face this problem when using 10g XE databases, this is really annoying!
very fun!! worth the memory.   :-d
How about an extension method that calls the actual () implementation? The only downside is you have to add . This works because the parameter (via ) infers a type for . As an alternative (if the is a pain), consider making it static, with an instance argument that is used primarily for type inference:
This was annoyingly annoying... If you have a the need to export your RegexBuddy history you can take a look at , which prints to the console your history, also as Json.

Usability notes: Personally I hate when sites put the "forgot password" or "forgot username" or "help" links inbetween the password field, and the Login button. As a keyboard user, I shouldn't have to TAB over them to get to the submit button. Better yet, also capture the Enter keypress on the password field so that I can auto-submit with the Enter key.

We are running Jenkins on a server that does not have internet access (even through proxy). Installing and keeping the Jenkins installation up-to-date is a pain! My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete Jenkins public update-site through a Windows workstation that has internet access. And then make this local mirror available to Jenkins through NFS share. So my questions: How to make the local mirror? Do you have a better/simpler idea to keep the Jenkins installation up-to-date?

I am using Eclipse 3.4.1. I have an external library that consists of a bunch of JAR files, and some HTML JavaDoc. I know that I can attach the HTML JavaDoc to individual JARs by going to their Properties page, JavaDoc location, and setting it there. But it would be a pain to do this for each individual JAR. Is it possible to do them all at once somehow? The JavaDoc location is the same for them all.

Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.

Indeed, but OP asked for a character not a substring. Of course if you interpret character broadly to include multibyte characters, `strstr` is the right function to use.
Excellent, now it's working! Thank you very much for your help with this.
FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.
i really love the jquery validation plugins, look neat stylish and accessible, but as you know JavaScript can be turned off and boom your user can enter what ever he wants, therefore you should validate on server too, so what is the best approach here ? do double validation one with jquery and one on server side or is there a better solid secure way ?
Having had some experience with using a thick client through VPN , I ' d say go with some kind of web app . If done wrong , a thick client can become really painful to use through a VPN because of data churning . A web app concentrates all of that on the server , which makes it much better from that point of view . Other benefits : no deployment hassle no direct access to the database from the user machine . Evidently it also depends on your skills , and on how much time / budget you have ... 
Nice feature, lars!!

It's generally better to keep them open. If you're concerned about being able to read them from another process, you need make sure that the share mode you use to open/create them allows others to read them (but not write to them, obviously). If you're worried about losing data in the event of a crash, you should periodically flush/commit their buffers.
and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.
I have developed my site with Firefox and firebug plugin, but when i deploy it to other browsers (IE/Chrome), the console window appears at the bottom of the screen(very annoying). How can i disable this? and why is it appearing? gath
Excellent answer to a very general question ! :-)
Chris, this regex matches *1* character from [^\w\W] character class. *Single* character.
For others coming here for a general word count, use `g Ctrl-g`.
If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.

The STL might be simple, but that's only one part of the C++ standard library. The iostreams library have nothing to do with (what was once) the STL. STL is basically contianers + iterators + algorithms. Iostreams, locales and all that has a completely different origin, and is generally a pain to work with ;)

You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.
PermGen memory can be garbage collected by full collections , so increasing it may increase the amount of GC time when a full collection takes place . These collections shouldn ' t take place too often though , and would typically still take less than a second to full GC 1GB of permgen memory - I ' m just pulling this number from ( my somewhat hazy ) memory , so if you are really worried about GC times to some timing tests yourself ( use and read the logs , more details ) 
I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line.

I don ' t think there are any mature components too ( for what I saw ) . You can use some dedicated DHTML components , like . We use it a lot in our project for our customers , and it ' s really great ! 
Why the down-votes and sniping? It's not a particularly well-asked question but it's certainly valid and by definition programming related. (it's pretty hard to do anything with Django without programming as it's a web programming framework!)

I have a situation where IE7 hangs accessing my web app. Based on the excellent from , I installed WinDbg to download the IE symbols, setup Process Explorer to use those symbols, and then used Process Explorer to get a stack trace for the hung thread.

I have a class , let ' s call it LineGraph , that renders a line graph . I need to subclass it , but the derived class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it . So I am using an inner class . I see two ways to do this : Anonymous inner class Named inner class I am not a fan of anonymous inner classes , because frankly I just think it looks really ugly . But in the case of a subclass that ' s only used in one place , is a named inner class overkill ? What is the accepted practice ?

No, there is no performance difference if the view is essentially a
You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.
I am suffering from the problem in the first example - my enums don't show up at all. This answer doesn't even attempt to address that issue.
Yes, you should implement pagination before that, at the SQL query stage. Otherwise there's nothing better than iterating and discarding (which is really horrible).

The paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the "main line" pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns. One of the authors is Robert Orenstein of Perforce.
Excellent! Can you post it as an answer?
Found the culprit ! At first I tried the solution suggested by @ billinkc in the comment , it worked ( I managed to create a folder ) but the folder wasn ' t usable as I couldn ' t upload packages . I have db _ owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder . What I really needed was the db _ ssisadmin permission . Not to worry as db _ owner permissions allow me to give myself the db _ ssisadmin permission ! After this was done , all the problems ( the one in the original Q and more ) disappeared . 
Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.
Add this to the main solution to make sure the the binding is updated to zero when the textbox is cleared.
Wow - excellent! How did you find this age old question? :)
If string object allocations worry you, then you should precompile the regular expression!
It will create a new enumerable , which may not be desirable in some scenarios . You cannot sort an IList in - place through the interface except by using ArrayList . Adapter method in my knowledge . 
I don't understand this part: One thing I've found with this is that passing the config around to all the other utility functions that I'd prefer and don't think should be a a part of one the the above mentioned classes can seem to get incredibly tedious. Anyway, look up on thread-local storage. You could make a singleton config object that is thread-local.
Triggering quirks mode is a terrible, terrible, terrible thing. In quirks mode, jQuery is forced to use alternative methods to interact with the DOM and is almost definitely the cause of your speed issues in IE.
CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.
On Visual Studio 2005 C++ compiler, I get the following warning when my code uses the fopen and such calls. How do I prevent this?
This isn't worthy of an "answer", but I thought I'd mention: many of the interfaces I've really enjoyed have been minimalistic -- there's almost nothing for me to see. Like QuickSilver for OS X.

The first line sets the file name variables and sets the field separator to comma . The second line sets the output field separator to comma too . The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file ; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file . Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line . This code has only one process operating on the whole file which will be really important if the input grow to thousand or millions or more lines . 
I always try to avoid to return string literals, because I fear they aren't defined outside of the function. But I'm not sure if this is the case. Let's take, for example, this function: Is this correct code? It does work for me, but maybe it only works for my compiler (gcc). So the question is, do (string) literals have a scope or are they present/defined all the time.

I'm completely horrible with javascript and jquery, How do I get the content from a PHP file?
@Stultuske Depends on the context. I would totally abuse a library.
When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.
Hello, Thanks a lot! It works.Lisa
The problem is in 'third integer' variable, missing the underscore. see my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Magicianred/3k5tS/Enjoy your code!Simone
Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the "OUT OF MEMORY" condition. Sure enough, these all succeeded (up to the 2GB limit).
How is it invariant if you're using the current culture?

So I ' m using activerecord to get the count of items for a certain day : But this doesn ' t give me if there are no records for a given day , how can I fix this ? Or is there are more " Rails " way do to something this ? Any help is hugely appreciated , thanks again ! 
completely agree, there are excellent answers provided here to this question
I use festAssertions in my tests and I noticed that using yields different results than in tests where hibernate objects are tested. I had to do workaround and now test looks really ugly but I cannot use because that just does not work! Here is partial code(look at last line): seasonRate, seasonRate1 are created and persisted. Then retrieved from db and checked against originals. Nothing fancy, but does not work with festAssertions. Do you have any idea how to fix that and if it is some error on my side or not?
that was from something else - that apparently the fragmentmanager holds on to fragments. But you're right - it doesn't make any difference one way or the other. Nice library by the way - extremely useful!
The TIFF file can store various image types: Bilevel (B/W) Grayscale Palette-color RGB full-color The storing of actual image data is done differently for each image type. The is not the scariest I have seen, but it is definitely not trivial!
Great links, thanks for your work!
In terms of performance and optimizations: When constructing a table in SQL Server, does it matter what order I put the columns in? Does it matter if my primary key is the first column? When constructing a multi-field index, does it matter if the columns are adjacent? Using ALTER TABLE syntax, is it possible to specify in what position I want to add a column? If not, how can I move a column to a difference position?
I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.
This only works if you have firefox installed.
What should I do to solve the issue?
You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!

Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps / build folders / etc . It ' s extremely annoying . If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode , delete the Default - 568 file and make sure to run Clean / Clean Build Folder in Xcode , and delete the app completely off your simulator / device . It should start showing up letterboxed again . Apple is still accepting 3.5 in only submissions . 
The skeleton-pair mechanism mentioned in the post preamble is quite general and is built-in to emacs -- no need to fetch wrap-region for new emacs installs or worry about wrap-region's compatibility.
Thanks to the two of you that answered . What I ended up doing ( in case anyone else is interested ! ) was processing the openid login normal , but NOT saving the new user to the database . Instead , I stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in . Hope this helps ! 
This is the table : What I have to change in the model ? Will ko3 ORM work ? 
Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.
I've had great success with 's Auto-Suggest implementation. It includes PHP examples too.
You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.
@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b, it would be aligned to offset 2, instead of 1?
Google led me to solution (base64_encode). Hope this helps!
I want to integrate the sweet sweet logo Andrew crafted.
Add this dependency to your API_NAME.
I generally do it before importing anything. If you're worried that your module names might conflict with the Python stdlib names, then change your module names!

I want an simple IDE/editor for C in Linux to which I can add features easily. For example: I want to add a right click menu item and a related action for the editor. It should be easy to extent and add any desirable functionality.

+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
A generic "Sum" method would be a simple example. T Sum(IEnumerable sequence)
Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.
If you are getting thrown off by the fact that the user/group is listed as having "Limited Access" on the ACLs on, say, the parent site/web. That's just a placeholder SharePoint uses to make sure people have access to at least the bare minimum set of objects (e.g. theme and other UI files and the parent web itself) to get to the list or item you actually want them to have access to. As long as the group only has access on a single list, you should have to worry about them having access to anything else.

Everytime I create a new IK handle in Maya via MEL, it creates an end effector named "effector1", or "effector2", depending on what is in my scene. I don't want to rely on the auto-name of the end effector, so I'm wondering if there is a way to either: a) name the effector at the create-time of the IK handle, or b) select the effector for a particular IK handle in MEL. Any help would be greatly appreciated -- thanks!
Fair enough: if your JDK upgrade messes up Serializable, the clients of the your big boy JDK (i.e. Sun, BEA, IBM, etc.) should scream bloody murder (and I have). Admittedly the question wasn't clear whether it was only about JDK classes.
Try this , you will avoid the much dreaded IN operator with subqueries ( they can sometimes be inefficient , to say the least ) ! 
If you are on 11g you are in Luck : - ) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch ! The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS , provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits ... Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing ( if you really want to code it yourself ... ) You can do it this : ( The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction . If the Update returns 0 Rows it can either be because the table is empty , or because two threads accessed the same row . - So we need a separate ending condition counting available rows . 
The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.
My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip , to check for NULL hitData objects , to kill / stop the drawing of the display . I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX . You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately . What a pain ! ! 
If you handle the RowDataBound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in VB rather than C#. Good Luck!

Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are approx 30Mb and take quite a while to download (our TFS server is in our datacentre).

I've been programming Ruby pretty extensively for the past four years or so, and I'm extremely comfortable with the language. For no particular reason, I've decided to learn some Python this week. Is there a specific book, tutorial, or reference that would be well-suited to someone coming from a nearly-identical language, or should I just "Dive into Python"? Thanks!
I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.
John, Your solution is absolutely awesome! But, just to share, I have been using this method above until I see your ideia. So, it seems not to be the best solution for this, but for sure it is a way around.
invaluable! i use this app daily and can't imagine not having it.
You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).
iâ€™ll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify `remove` in an interface, just to add `throws UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.

Right now I am using : This functions as I wanted but I am trying to figure out how to do this in a way where the user does not see the ? parameters at the end of their URL . Is there a way to do this same thing but without them being able to see it ? Any help would be hugely appreciated -- thanks ! 
If you are worried that the overhead of calling functions is slowing you down, why not test inlining the C code or turning it into macros? Also, why not improve the const correctness of the C code while you are at it - const_cast should really be used sparingly, especially on interfaces you control.

This is one of the shortcomings of DGV that I absolutely hate and why I almost always bind to an IEnumerable of an anonymous type.
Don't use it. I hate std::pair exactly for this reason. You never know which is which, and since access to first and second are public you can't enforce contracts either. But after all, it's a matter of taste.
I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).
I built an xml-rpc server in Python using SimpleXMLRPCServer, according to the example in the Python documentation. I'm calling it from a Python client on the same machine. The body of the server function executes very fast on its own. But I find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow, taking one second per call. (Using xmlrpclib.) A speed-up technique I found on the web () didn't help. My connect URI is: I'm running Python 2.7 x64 on Windows 7, but it works the same for 32-bit Python 2.7.

Has anyone built a website with IronPython and ASP.NET. What were your experiences and is the combination ready for prime-time?
A simple Google search would suffice for this question. All are excellent resources (and the top three Google links!). Essentially, there's a new API which allows JS to request fullscreen access. That's about it.

Was afraid someone would say that...! Is there any hack I could put in place?
Shit, my bad. The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo - I had not realized I ran the test-patch against a branch not branch-1.
Firstly , that ' s not how works . You have to specify constants for each , and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses ( in your case , ) . That is how works , period . Secondly , switch is not faster than several s And thirdly , you shouldn ' t really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you ' re dealing with javascript . 
WPF is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on ! The ability to style just about anything , the databinding support and attached / dependency properties . Wow ! But let ' s not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great , it ' s not the best ... yet .

Yes, your PHP configuration has correctly got turned off, because that's incredibly insecure. Just put: at the top of your script. You can also use if you specifically only want this to work for the HTTP method. I've seen some people claim that is somehow insecure, but no evidence to back that up.

I would recommend 2 things: - Calculate and combine polygons that are touching. This involves a LOT of processing and hard math, but I've done it so I know it's possible. - Create your own overlay instead of using KML in PNG format, while you combine them in the previous suggestion. You'll have to create a LOT of PNGs but it is blazing fast on the client. Good luck :)
I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.

Instead of logging to the console , log to a file and then track the file with a separate gui application . This keeps the console uncluttered and gives you a more persistent record of your log , which occasionally is extremely useful . There are various libraries which will do most of this for you , or you can keep it simple and just do it yourself .

Configuraton doesn't belong in a library. I think you nailed it with "emerging anti-pattern". It's really pretty easy to locate configuration files relative to a library; they don't need to physically go in the same JAR to be found.
When I run the project, I get the following error,.
One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it (due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a DOS attack against the server. Then again, servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long. So I doubt this would be much of a problem.

By now my 4 column grid has many white space on the right but I find this very ugly, better if all column expand or collapse based on window size change! Is there a way to get this to works?
No prob. Good luck!
Why do you need the class explicitly? Couldn't you use the interface? Note that casting is not encouraged, which is why it looks so awful in Scala!

good app it's customizable which i like. sometimes it's a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don't change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don't like. overall it's a good app though.
Have you tried using SetWindowPos. This is the canonical function for moving, resizing and setting z-order in Windows. There is a SWP_NOACTIVATE flag you can use. Look at (VS.85).aspx. I have not tried this on a window belonging to another process, but it is probably worth a try.
The same number is: 2.

whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this?

What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.
An object created by a user is really no different from one you create yourself (except you have to be suspicious of potentially malicious input!). The simplest way to be able to edit objects outside the admin interface is to use the built-in . Similarly you can delete them with a . If you want to restrict you can edit objects you can user the from .
@NoBugs a NullPointerException can be thrown for 1000 reasons. Are you sure you load the .wav correctly? Are you sure it is in the right path? IIRC, the .wav file should be inside the compiled jar. Although I might be terribly wrong.
Lastly, I don't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?

Have you run this on SQL Server?
There are a few plugins which you could look at for that functionality, if not flat-out use: Good luck, hope these help!
Also, your query is completely vulnerable to SQL injection. If you don't know what that is, look it up.

As an aside, if you can use a pull parser and not a SAX parser. They're much easier to work with. With SAX you have to worry about saving state between the callbacks.
I don't have any code to show because I don't know where to start.
This is flat wrong I'm afraid - you should follow W3C guidelines: http://www.w3schools.com/DTD/dtd_el_vs_attr.asp - XML should not be formed on readability or on making it "compact" - but rather using elements or attributes correctly for the purpose which they were designed for.

In netbeans, if I select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying. Is there any way to change this setting, so backspacing behind a tabbed line causes the whole tab to be removed and not just 1 space?
I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired.

great alarm  but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm  i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist. but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps. i'm guessing it's something to do with sunrise feature. i don't use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don't move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating. so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful. otherwise i'll have to go back to the standard alarm until it's fixed.

@ryanc: Excellent! Now I understand what is going on, rather than just thrashing, as before. I think your explanation (about the canvas ignoring `refresh-now` before it is open) is very sensible. (If any Racket developers are listening here, it seems a valuable tool would be a way to pause until the frame is ready for action, platform-independent.)
Sorry, most of the code for this is 3rd party and I do not have access to it, making things extremely difficult/frustrating.
The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.

The following scripting is a custom addition to this Hover Fade Button ; in my version it keeps the text of the button while changing the background images through css classes only .

Greatly appreciate a solution !

I've got an application that I'm moving over to ClickOnce and the app has a moderately sized data folder with hundreds of files that I need to inlcude in the deployment.

Any suggestions would be great - Thanks!

If you give each key a unique name, e.g. "invoices.invoice_id" instead of "invoices.id", then you can use the "natural join" and "using" operators with no worries. E.g. instead of SQL is verbose enough without making it more verbose.

You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
Excellent! Thanks for telling me about this. I'll be watching this.
I always seem to use Get when working with data ( strongly typed or otherwise ) from the database and I have never really needed to use Fill although I just as easily could use Fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data .

Thanks in advance for the answers ! I love this community ! 
Thanks--good answers. This is, in fact, a DateTime type; I had to typecast "stoptime" as: Minor point. It works great!
One thing I forgot, make sure the dev database you are running the migration from (the sql server database) is updated from production immediately before each test run. Hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records.

Entering "udp://host:666" in the location bar doesn't work very well. Is there any work-around for sending a single "empty" datagram to a host using an ordinary web browser? The response is no issue since the use case I'm think about is port knocking ("http://host:666" doesn't work well since browsers tend to repeat the request if there is no response, thus violating the designated knock sequence).

@JoranBeasley Please read [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html). Unicode is not a character encoding and not concerned with bytes, though as a matter of fact you cannot fit all unicode code points into 16 bit because there are more than 2^16 of them.
You could try using the HTML <button> tag instead of a link or a submit button. For example, The <button> tag is much easier to style than the standard <input type="submit">.

I can think of scenarios where initial sealing might be desirable until inheritance is required. I have some libraries that make use of the implied 'sealed' knowledge to optimise some dynamic (run-time) processing (e.g. the knowledge that there is never going to be a derived class).

Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:

The issue is , when using I get pointed to a folder at " C : \ Program Files ( x86 ) \ Common Files \ Microsoft Shared \ DevServer \ 10.0 " . Naturally , this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder ( the one my solution is actually in ) being given . What is more strange is that there exists a unit - test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected , and then the very next debug , will point to the aforementioned folder again . Very confusing and very annoying ! Any ideas ? 
I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers.

There is another way ... As the WPF application is coded with the . NET framework , it is compiled to MSIL ( Microsoft Intermediate Language ) . This means you can use a decompiler such as ILSpy to decompile and view the code of BaronReplays .

NicoGranelli mentioned Nancy(). It's really great! Plz check this project JabbR() It's a chat involving SignalR and Nancy. Great Job!
( I ' m assuming you don ' t have a DMR . ) There is no easy / clean way to do this in Cognos . In your query , you ' ll have to build a calculation for each year in your output . So , something this for 2013 : And basically the same for 2014 . Cut the Trans piece out of your crossab . Then you ' ll nest those two calcs under your years . To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls , select the two columns . From the menu , select , , . Finally , you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab ( not under them ) . The expression will be ( or whatever you end up naming your calcs ) . Format it as a percent , and you should be good to go . Told you it was a pain ! 
When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.
I want to to do this, on an 8-bit micro controller with the least possible number of instructions.
I know how to query workitems , although I haven ' t been very successful finding info on the WIQL . There ' s one basic example that seems to get repeated everywhere . I ' d like to be able to query changesets . Can I do it with tf . exe , tfpt . exe , or .. ? 
Just wondering what actually happens after you exceed 2147483647 records?
I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
I want to change an image of an UIImageView from the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of the app delegate class. But I am afraid that this class doesnt know much about the controller outlet. What must I do in this case?
Anybody found yet a good web site architecture using linq to sql ? Any help will be very helpful !

This is extremely unsafe! Use `mysqli` or `pdo` instead of `mysql_`.
I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.
I am working with Eclipse (Indigo) to develop C projects. When I create a new C project in a new workspace, by default the "Autosave before build" option is not set. This is extremely frustrating, as autosave is usually the default behavior in other IDE's I worked on. I change some code, build and nothing seems to go as expected - until I remember that the option is not set... Is there a way to make Eclipse open a new workspace with this option set?
lovely! this is lovely apk.
Okay, a before <example> And a desired after <example> I know, horrific (don't ask!) See how the slash in the key indicates children, and how the order is nested accordingly? And items without orders are simply shifted to the bottom. But also how multiple 'same level' items with the same order are merely sorted by key?
I hate it too. But did you stop to think why i wanted to do this instead of just assuming im an idiot? Its a small personal site, not a money maker. Rebuilt it to learn a new technology. Not bothered 301ing pages to their new versions. So instead trying to get some value to the homepage.
I want to ask some questions.
Hey, I saw that you used asyncsocket to get the desired result. Any chance I could pick your brains about this sometime? I'm @suprfrends on twitter. It would be GREATLY appreciated!
Nice! I love the video software! lol. Had to download it. Anyway, I fixed the Open Modal, I didn't fix teh fixed modal. I'll get back to you in a minute
sooo annoying!! its a good app and it works fine but sometimes it just freezes and when i go on my actual camera it says it failed so i have to turn the phone off and turn it i'm again!! plz fix this!!!
The named scopes already proposed are pretty fine. The clasic way to do it would be:
But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.
I'll second Zend_Form; it has an excellent ini style implementation that allows you to define a form extremely quickly:
I'll bet you that your main's function signature is incorrect. You use: but SDL_main.h wants Aside: You see, SDL does something really horrific when compiling: It renames your function to , injecting its own main function which, in turn, calls yours. Note that if this doesn't work, then you may be compiling with wrong flags. To be sure, take the flags by running: For more information, see
It can't be closed, but you can remove the OK button by specifying a function as the 3rd parameter: But seriously think about this, because spawning unclosable dialog boxes won't exactly make people overjoyed about your site.
Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)
This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
It dependes where it is exactly located.
It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.
wow, awesome! never knew this. Thanks again!
Sorry, I meant to have this patch in sooner but got quite busy, I expect to have it soon.
Just making a note that this answer is now out of date. The feature is available.
If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.
The issue at hand , is that your parent thread finishes , but doesn ' t check if there are child threads left which are still running , which are silently killed in this manner ! I would recommend the following approach : Instead of use change your thread code around : to Similar answered . 
terrible ppl have 4g.."error occurs  please try again"...fix it ...or bye bye...no one talks on this site anyway
My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow, I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in, and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?
You also might want to check out Uche Ogbuji ' s excellent XML Data Binding Library , Amara : ( Documentation here : ) The cool thing about Amara is that it turns an XML document in to a Python object , so you can just do stuff : ( which creates a Record element that contains Name and Value elements ( which in turn contain the values of the name and value variables ) ) . 
@Martinho: Indeed. But you have to learn an awful lot of C++ to understand WTF type traits do, and what the corresponding syntax means!
encryption/decryption of the relevant code as well, and emit the IL. This would be another layer of obscurity that although doesn't ultimately protect you really, it does make it a little more of a pain. Also, post your question at reverse-engineering.net forums and see what those crackers say.
Excellent thank you guys!
If they do then Suse's cpio works for old ascii but the -c switch is broken.
+1 for the /f I've written couple of scripts for that but without /f it was such a pain; required me to be there when running the script to type "y+[return]"

I solved this need by using . I am able to route calls from Edge to my local machine. Absolutely love ngork! :-)
OK, so what do you want me to do about that? Hint: how about *telling us* what your problem is?
Crashes for me on a virtual machine without Flash loaded. I hate annoying Flash embeds as much as the next guy, but â€œusing it is BADâ€ might be overegging it slightly...
No worries and good luck with it! ;)
I need to see the contents of the viewstate of an asp.net page. I looked for a viewstate decoder, found but it asks for the url of a page to get its viewstate. Since my viewstate is formed after a postback and comes as a result of an operation in an update panel, I cannot provide a url. I need to copy & paste the viewstate string and see what's inside. Is there a tool or a website exist that can help viewing the contents of viewstate?
Can you show us some code? Extremely difficult to diagnose otherwise.
An excellent book I have, which covers this topic, is , by Clifton Nock. It has got many good explanations and good ideas on how to decouple your business layer from the persistence layer. You really should give it a try. It's one of my favorite books.
There's an excellent series of posts on execution plans and how to read and interpret them - and a totally free e-book on the topic as well! - on the excellent Simple-Talk site. Check them out - well worth the time!
In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.
The following ( cut down ) code excerpt is a Linq - To - Entities query that results in SQL ( via ToTraceString ) that is much slower than a hand crafted query . Am I doing anything stupid , or is Linq - to - Entities just bad at optimizing queries ? I have a ToList ( ) at the end of the query as I need to execute it before using it to build an XML data structure ( which was a whole other pain ) . While working on this , I ' ve also has some real problems with Dates . When I just tried to include returned dates in my data structure , I got internal error " 1005 " . 
This reply is incomplete: we currently have an app that is leaking permgen memory and the number of loaded classes is absolutely constant. Both facts can be seen by using JConsole. We suffer from the same problem as the original poster in that we have no way to analyze the permgen in detail.
Please contact me if you need any clarifications.
And it fits with MVVM. +1
Here is another one to consider http://tableview.codeplex.com
or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.
What platform ? What languages will you accept ? 
is in so u need not to worry! Internally the data is always stored as TEXT, so even if you create table with , SQLite is going to follow the rules of data type
The ToolStripManager is hopelessly broken. LoadSettings doesn't do a thing...and I'm evidently not the only one with this problem: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=128042 So...anyone have a workaround? The one posted in that thread just moved all the toolbars to the bottom of the window.
When specified as above , Spring distinguishes constructor arguments by order of appearance . The notation would only switch between setting the attributes by constructor to setting them by accessor . I ' m afraid , this will not change anything . 
Coding horror!!!
For instance , will I be able to create an application that allows users to create and modify existing types at runtime ? Will I be able to persist instances of those types in SQL without having to worry about the user who adds 100,000 records and expects a ( really ) fast query on them ? Think SharePoint Content Types ... but on steroids . Oslo steroids - Possible or not ?

This is a common problem , and it ' s not a matter of " PHP is lying to me ! " You have to understand how PHP sends the emails , and how servers interpret and process them . Your email host is likely interpreting these emails as spam , and sending them to a quarantine folder . None of this has anything to do with how PHP is handling your email . 
I'm sorry Mark, I came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch I have found that by default it used WhenExhaustedAction = GROW and not BLOCK!
I'm really glad it worked! Btw, the best way to show appreciation on Stack Overflow if someone helps to solve your problem is to upvote their answer and mark it as solved :)
I love it when I find the answer to my question without having to ask - thanks for running into the same question I had and helping me work through my issues!
Filip is both correct and incorrect, at least wrt to Java and ASP.NET. An applet can get access to the ASP.NET session by cheating. In my case, we added the session id as a parameter to the applet, which the applet then adds as a cookie in it's requests. Seems to work ok. (We encrypted the session id to foil those nasty hacker folk!)
? very big wins and i love playing it
if you ' re really , really worried about performance , using a live nodelist might be faster : This is unlikely to make much of a difference though , and as has been mentioned , using setInterval with long intervals ( a second is big , 4ms is small ) is unlikely to have any major effects . 
It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.
Yeah, I thought the same thing when I was writing the answer.
Does iTextSharp support Windows Metro Apps? I am trying to create PDFs from a C# Metro App, but PdfWriter.GetInstance requires some arguments which is not available in WinRT. Any help would be EXTREMELY appreciated!
I asked before about pixel-pushing, and have now managed to get far enough to get noise to show up on the screen. Here's how I init: Here's how I render each frame: Problem is this is awfully awfully slow, around 5fps. I think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong. Is it even possible to do full-screen pixel-based graphics that I could update at 30fps, without using the 3D chip?
I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not , but then there are two things you could try : 1 . Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist . The class might look this : To access the list you could write : is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it . Else you might get . Also a receiver might start before the list is filled . So always check for null before you use it . 2 . The other option is you store the list in a cache object Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it . Hope that helps ! 
I see. Everything makes sense now. Thanks a lot for the excellent answers!
One of the first cool demos in the 1.0 era was page turn photo book . The idea caught a bit of traction and Jeff Prosise wrote up a framework for it What I ' m looking for is an update to 3.0 ( or at least 2.0 ) While I appreciate Prosise effort , I ' m not that thrilled about all the Javascript required to drive the application . Any pointers ? This is primarily for a learning exercise , so canned controls are of limited interest . 
Why would you return an IList in the first place? From a WCF service?
After installing Node, fresh installation of Yeoman throws several warnings. Command Warnings I am not sure, whether I should be worried about these warnings or just ignore them! Either ways I want to understand the reason behind getting these warnings.
Awesome, that did it! Thanks David!
Sweet! Git, I love git! :)
No worries! Keep at it...it's overwhelming at first, but it gets easier
I'm afraid not! AFAIK, the English resources aren't available at all in other international editions of the OS.
+1 for this question - I have the same issue.
Good question. I noticed method entry breakpoints slow things down considerably when I'm debugging Java programs with Eclipse. I hope someone has the answer!
The was a pretty awesome read/reference! Although there are some typos, etc., it is really extensive and has tons of examples. C & C++.
For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
A stupid bug in a patch that is already applied.

I have a file in the form If I try to splot such file, gnuplot intended it as a surface, and the result is very awful (because the endpoint of a line is close to the endpoint of next line, not to the first point). How can I plot them as different lines (as every line was in a different file)?
Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.
Excellent, well thought out and worded question. +1, more if it were only possible!
That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.

We ' re in the process of packaging combinations of our products / modules . Some of them are stand - alone some are interdependent . All versions must be deployable side - by - side . As it is we ' re considering two choices : One MSI per package and version One MSI per product / module and version The first alternative would mean that combinations of the same merge modules would be delivered in several packages . The second alternative represents the simpler path . Can you give some advice on the subject ? Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run ?

There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.
then you might want to take full control over how Preferences should follow your desired storage by implementing . You can see a linux based implementation here: Good luck!
I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.
There is a such thing as a [ sublime - project ] ( http : / / www . sublimetext . com / docs / 3 / projects . html ) file which you could check into Version control , but it seems it could be overridden by Syntax specific settings per the [ settings doc ] ( http : / / www . sublimetext . com / docs / 3 / settings . html ) , and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit . [ This blog ] ( http : / / net . tutsplus . com / tutorials / tools - and - tips / sublime - text - 2 - project - bliss / ) is also interesting and applicable . 
You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.
I always tend to forget these built-in symfony functions for making links.
Also if someone could please let me know if my question is hard to understand , I will re - state . This is incredibly frustrating ... suddenly my Stylus files are not compiling at all , and I have not changed any code . 
When all of the bugs from previous patches get merged into the main tree, we lose the "who did what" information. I think it is a shortcoming of TFS for sure. Too many bug fix comments hurt in the long term - people are then afraid to touch stuff.
If I start a process with exec ( ) , how can I later terminate that process , with say pressing / sending the " q " key . Instead of using , you could look at using , which requires that you pass in an array specifying three -- one for , one for and one for . This will let you easily feed input into the program while processing output , without blocking just waiting for it to execute . You can later use to viciously murder it , if needed . 
This would be easiest with a - no need to be scared, it's just a box!
When you call "su" you're creating a new process that runs that command, so after running exec("su") you have a new process with SU rights. You can't give your already running application SU rights I'm afraid! I'm not sure how other applications do this, but you can run "su -l ls /data" and then read from the outputstream of the process.

I'm trying to bake my controllers but I keep getting the following error: It's making me frightfully sad, has anyone ever come across this?
i really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user control , and make sub folder images , css , and put local resource file , so the whole thing is contained in one folder , and that makes it really efficient for me ( management wise ) . but the bugger is you cant get intellisence global resource , so is it possible in any way ? 
Is it possible to hide .svn files in the Open Resource dialog (Ctrl + Shift + R) of Eclipse? It's very annoying when you have hundreds of files... Cheers.

Stu Nicholls's site has a lot of examples of how to do this without javascript. It's a really excellent resource.
Thanks for doing that Uma.
Yes, I'm afraid so. Do you happen to have a "Hello world" haproxy conf that captures a cookie, and an example request that triggers it?
Probably the date format does not match the string and `dateFromString` is `nil`. - Single-stepping in the debugger (and inspecting the variables) can be extremely helpful!
To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.

API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.
Makes sense, and it's very similiar to what I am doing. One ant task for stage and one for production, and just using the defaults for local development. But pain arises from mainting 3 different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content..

Assuming I have only the class name of a generic as a string in the form of "MyCustomGenericCollection(of MyCustomObjectClass)" and don't know the assembly it comes from, what is the easiest way to create an instance of that object? If it helps, I know that the class implements IMyCustomInterface and is from an assembly loaded into the current AppDomain. Markus Olsson gave an excellent example , but I don't see how to apply it to generics.
Get at that with Firebug and you'll notice something about the classes of the generated dialog - ui-widget and/or ui-state are completely absent, but those are the classes that ThemeRoller uses to color UI elements! Is there some sort of ThemeRoller-compliant dialog generator, or even a script to hack the right display classes into a dialog after the fact? Or, since I'm not intending to let my users edit their own themes, do I just have to do the bit of CSS hackery that the jQuery people apparently did , putting color information into ui.dialog.css?
So you must change the signature of your method to.
Use java dom api or sax for xml parsing. Give more concrete xml structure.
Unfortunately if you want to make this an open API , many people will be unable to use Content - Type headers . The sad reality is that you usually need to allow some hacks , even if you permit the standardized way too . 
I would guess it is doing basic sanity checking ( i . e . should anything have changed ) - to prevent unexpected source code changes ( I hate it when opening a file can cause side - effects - I ' m looking at you , DBML ! ) .

Indeed your question is an easy one , so I answer your question with some additional points that I think help you more than the answer itself : First , this is the code : Notes : Please1 - don ' t a simple problem a real hard one ! if it ' s a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something " , " ( if he / she insists ) or whatever , and if this is a real project convince the customer , you don ' t want to torture yourself ! 2 - you said you want to split the string into a 4 x 4 matrix , what if you want a 5x5 matrix ? So take advantage of constants , and the same for the delimiter Hope these help . 
A colleague recently asked me how to deep-clone a Map and I realized that I probably have never used the clone() method- which worries me. What are the most common scenarios you have found where you need to clone an object?

Linked lists have operations which a FIFO queue does not ( enumerate the list , remove items from the middle , etc ) . So personally , I ' d fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation , then in future some fool ( probably me ) will fail to observe the FIFO constraint . 
I agree with PW. OPAL is an excellent choice. It supports audio and video devices It compiles on windows, linux, and a few others Also - I recommend using the SIP protocol (as opposed to H323) - You don't need to use Ekiga. Ekiga is a front-end to OPAL. You can take a look at the OPAL samples, and build up from those.

excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator  in spite of some (minor) shortcomings. it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps. the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses  and with these  the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes. one useful feature which it does not have at the moment  is the ability to paste/insert data copied from  say  a text file. this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file. nevertheless  this is an excellent app  and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done  and for generously making it available a no cost.
It's always a balance: - too much TDD and you end up with code that works, but is a pain to work on. - too much 'maintable code, clean design, and sound architecture' and you end up with that have talked themselves into coding paralysis Moderation in all things.
Update way later: there's actually a built in function to get the current user. I think it's in nativeApplication.

Regarding selling agile, one angle of approach is proposing agile techniques as a way of reducing the "project crunch". By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues, "99% complete" code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s).

You already have a great answer, but I wanted to give you a resource so you don't actually have to install IE8. You can use this site to test IE6-9, FF2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3-5, and Opera 9-10. It's a really excellent tool!
I used for a medium sized project, and loved it. It's incredibly feature-rich, has pretty good documentation, and an amazingly good support forum -- it's one of those ones where you ask a question, and a guy who works for the company that produces the software almost invariably answers it within a few hours. I used it with PHP and MySQL, but as far as I know it works with ASP.NET as well.

Ok, now it is 2014 and you should never use `eval` in order to parse a JSON string because you would be exposing your code to "code injection". Use `JSON.parse(yourString)` instead.

I am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour. If you look at the Kitchen Sink page for foundation, the default styles for secondary buttons hover affect is different to what I get if I set foundation up in rails. Note these images are from my rails application Image 1 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - no hover Image 2 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - with hover However on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site. It transitions to a darker shade of grey. Have I missed some setting? Really frustrating me! I am guessing this is a bug in foundation

I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).

I've been using a custom function for some time now to prevent clickjacking on certain sites. However, I've been surprised to find there's not a lot out there about how to do this 'idiomatically' using the various popular JavaScript frameworks.

My understanding is that APPLET is deprecated and OBJECT is the preferred tag to use for Java applets . Is this correct ?

Also , can you provide an example of proper OBJECT tag usage for Java applets ?

@JonHanna Why, then, did he invoke "Hoare's dictum"? Knuth's paper was more about clarity than about optimization. The quote never actually appears in the paper; rather, he wrote "In our previous discussion we concluded that premature emphasis on efficiency is a big mistake which may well be the source of most programming complexity and grief".

Newbie question. Iâ€™m writing an ASP.Net MVC app in VB.Net and have been using NerdDinner as a sample (which is in C#). Iâ€™m stuck on the validation process specifically the code found in Models\Dinner.cs . I have tried converting it to VB.Net using but it chokes on the Yield statement which found in the GetRuleViolations method (see code below). So my question is how would you do the equivalent in VB.Net? namespace NerdDinner.Models { }
Would it be possible for you to post the code here? That would be awesome!
A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs , otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally , and that could be a real pain to debug . Try seeding your pseudo - randomizer with the same seed every time ( in the test , that is -- not in production code ) . That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time . If you can ' t control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized , then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test . : (

So I came up with what is undoubtedly an extremely ugly solution: I took the Response JS data attributes out of the body tag, and used the Response.create method instead.

Paraphrasing Cypher, "StateOf.Confusion is bliss", so... Do all `MapCollection Items` have the same state? If so then have a single `ItemStatus` that every `Item` references.

You should prepare your statement only once, outside of the loop, and then bind the parameters in the loop. This is why prepared statements have bind parameters - so you can reuse the prepared statement. Hibernate does exactly this, treating all SQL as a prepared statement behind the scenes, though you can obviously abuse this if you use literal rather than bind parameters.
I would say yes, it was Anders Heljsberg's intent to make the observer pattern a first-class language feature with events in C#, based on his experience with Delphi. Anders makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on .

The class in Java has only two data members , a reference to an array and a sizeâ € ” which you need anyway if you don ' t use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation , which is unlikely ever to be a big deal .

Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries .

`internal` exists so that API vendors (such as MS) can write classes without worrying about random strangers using their code. Whenever an API becomes public, the vendor can no longer easily change the signatures. When `internal`, if MS chooses to, they can change their code without fear of breaking other people's code. That is, unless they are using reflection to "cheat".

is not an , it's a basic type. You can only add NSObject-derived objects to an NSArray. The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because, under the covers, it's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words, it's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.

Would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as " 1 2 3 4 " , " 1 2 3 4 " , etc ? It would look something this : 1st column | second columnA | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1A | 2B | 2C | 2D | 2If you order it by 2nd column , it will return 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 . But since you have another column , you can do order by 1st column , 2nd column , and it will be 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 . This ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field 1st column . But given that you ' re looking at having them order 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 , there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that Hope this helps !

J# was, from the very beginning, a migration language. There were lots of devs who had used VJ++, Microsoft's version of Java. When .NET came out, the company provided J# as a way to move those devs and their code, unchanged, to .NET. Today, starting out, there is no reason to use J#.
New to programming and this is my very first post ! Very exciting : D Thank you all in advance for sharing your expertise . I would like to be able to somehow reference the earlier created timer and to be able to extend it ( call Change upon its instance perhaps ? ) on Button2 _ Click . Please take a look at the code below : 
In this case, I'd keep the DoStuff() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that won't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally. (I also hate the autogenerated event handler names...)
@chucklukowski wow, that's just about exactly what I was looking for! I'll be giving that a read-thru. Much appreciated.
Does anyone know of a link to a reference on the web that contains a sample English dictionary word script, that can be used to populate a dictionary table in SQL Server? I can handle a .txt or .csv file, or something similar. Alternatively, I'm adding custom spellchecking functionality to my web apps...but I don't want to integrate the standard components. If there are good references (with samples) on building a dictionary word checker, I'd love that too!

I ' m running socket . io / node . js on my EC2 auto - scaling array of servers . As soon as I have more than 1 server , there is the obvious problem where the socket . io connections need to be shared between the servers . This is where you ' d normally use the redis store plugin that comes with socket . io . Unfortunately , I use MongoDB ( not redis ) , and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high . I tried using the module , but it absolutely killed my servers ( huge CPU usage ) . Is there any other way to share the socket . io session between EC2 servers ? 
What is the code equivalent of setting endpoint headers in configuration?
Godd luck, hope you figure it out! :)
Freeing the local array " buffer " is undefined , and probably horrible , behavior ! You can ' t free something unless it was allocated with malloc ( ) or calloc ( ) . It ' s likely corrupting the heap and causing the crash . 
What matters is that your code is readable. If you're worried, add a comment -- that's what they're for! Having said that, maybe you should StopIteration when there are no more players.

Why don't the bytes intersect??
I see... that's really great! Thanks!
Typically you would handle that as a POST (not a GET), and read the xml from the request-stream (or there are helpers to let you do this). Otherwise URL encoding and length restrictions are going to make this extremely painful.
I used ExcelLibrary with very great results! (until now it support Excel 2003 or lower versions).

I'm reading about the CallContext class (). The documentation says something about "logical threads" and "Thread Local Storage". What's a logical thread, I didn't know that there existed multiple kinds of threads? What's a Thread Local Storage, is it a class or a principle of some kind? I have not been able to find it in on MSDN, but I'm sure it is there some place, so any links would be great :-)
What about forgetting all the wrapping of the functor pointer, and instead use as the functor? that way, you don't have to worry about managing the copy in any way shape or form.

So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.

@augustss: with `ImpredicativeTypes` you can make monadic binds polymorphic as well (though it requires a heck lot of extremely ugly type annotations).

This ws-addressing issue is a real pain in the ass. Not only does WSS2 use an old, pre-release version of WS-Addressing, it adds propritery elements to the soap header (e.g. wsa:via) that arent part of the schema. What a crock.
Actually it doesn't even have to be malicious code. It could just be a accidental name collision.

Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB
Isn't and the same thing here??
Why use a ` Mutex ` here ? The ` Acquire ` method just returns a reference to an instance ( this is a reference type ) . Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant . The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates . Why do locking ? Even if the instance was not " singleton " or " read - only " , i . e . even if the field reference could change , since [ reference assignments are atomic ] ( http : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 5209623 / ) , there would still be no need for locking / ` Mutex ` . I will downvote this answer @ + 109 net upvotes ...

After installing a lot of apps, and building a few myself, I'm sure many people have been wondering about this. If I'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible, and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/videos/pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we, the developers, should try to put their apps into one base folder or has Google forgot about this completely?
I don't see much out there for java but I would look into with JNI.
I recommend you take a look at how merlin does it, as suggested by Erik Allik, e.g. https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/emacs/merlin.el#L430 starts a process, and https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/emacs/merlin.el#L631 sends a command to the ocaml merlin process, with an async handler.

I'm afraid I can't entirely follow your question - do you want to have a sign up form for membership or email notifications shown as an article? If so, then the easiest way is to install 'm2c' - the 'module to component' component. Then you can put any module (ie the sign up box) in the centre content area. The m2c component can be found here:

I've been using for a little while now, but there's one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or I just can't figure out (I hope the latter!). If you pass cfg.getTemplate() an absolute path, it just doesn't work. I know you can specify a template directory, but I can't afford to do that, my use case could deal with files in any directory. Is there any way to set FreeMarker to render absolute paths the way any user would expect?
Setting the property of your picker controller to should remove the focus square (it did pre 4.3, I don't think anything has changed), but the downside is you'll need to provide your own controls (to take photos, etc). It's all or nothing I'm afraid!
This is horrible . First you ' re sleeping , which will never wait exactly the right amount of time . It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected .

I would suggest renaming the file in the repository from config.php to config.php.sample. This is the file that you would edit to change the default options. For deployment, either to your development environment or to the production server, you would copy config.php.sample to config.php and edit it without worrying about future conflicts.
@ecu - Excellent :) I added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier, it seems comments aren't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason.
If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).
Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.

Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex.

For various reasons Microsoft decides that some info should be kept away from developers.

I am sorry for posting so many questions , but getting this to work has been incredibly painful , even tho Testflight makes it much easier I figure this has got to do with my Apple Push Notifications . I am using my distribution profile across all my settings . My app has been configured to both development and production . What could the causes of this error be ? As a side note , i have been working on this for the entire day , and i get stuck at one thing after the other , esp involving static libraries and xcode4 . Am I really bad at this , or does Apple really make it so hard ? 
I think I read somewhere recently ( might even have been on SO but I can ' t find the question ) that in a debug session , pressing stop in VS just kills the process and no GC takes place .

My problem with Boost (here, and elsewhere) is that you can often get on without it (in this case with C++11 or before C++11 [with a function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/138633/111307)). Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.
I can't comment (yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing Mr. David Murdoch's advice is the best for Opera ( ). OMG, what a lovely girl he's got btw.

Like others I'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well. The clear differences between lowercase L and number 1 and the letter O and zeronumber 0 for example also makes this a really good programming font.

I don't think you want this - if I'm typing a document into Word and I hit K, I'm going to be very angry when your application pops up instead of a "k" appearing in my document.

Right-click on a desktop icon and go to Properties, and look for the field marked "Shortcut key".

In fact it's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the TextRange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate '\t's generated by pressing the Tab key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?

@gnud: No, it's not an implementation detail. It makes it a pain when you've been given an integer in "natural" base (i.e. Jan=1) and you need to use it with the calendar API.
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).

Here are my tables. And here are my object classes I'm brand new to dapper and orm in general, so please bare with me. Would a many-to-many relationship be possible to map out with dapper? If so, could someone provide a coding sample, that would be extremely helpful! I am also open to switching to a heavier orm if that would make these advanced mapping scenarios a lot simpler.
The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an "on demand return" instead of an "always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it.
If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.
I don't do c# anymore but yes I remember those templated stuff was really painful.

I know I can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered , but there is a high change there will be duplicates , with the only difference being the id . 
Creating custom types can be done in PowerShell . Kirk Munro actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly . The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types . The book is excellent all around , so I really recommend it .

If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.
The answer was devastatingly simple in this case. For some reason windows uses localhost as opposed to 0.0.0.0. So although it says standing watch at 0.0.0.0:4567 it is actually standing watch at localhost:4567 . You should be able to navigate to this page and see your middleman build.

Is there any difference between: and The convention that I've seen in most Python code (and the code I myself write) is the former, but I recently came across code which uses the latter.

With regard to Peter Lawrey's note that you don't need instanceof for final classes and can just use a reference equality, be careful! Even though the final classes cannot be extended, they are not guaranteed to be loaded by the same classloader. Only use x.getClass() == SomeFinal.class or its ilk if you are absolutely positive that there is only one classloader in play for that section of code.

The question is , how do I refer to each textview on each listview item ? I can ' t do it by name using , can I ? If there are three items in the list , will the temperature textview for each item be names the same , just differ by an array index ? If so , how do I specify TextViewName ( 0 ) , TextViewName ( 1 ) and TextViewName ( 2 ) for the three list items ? Yes , I ' m still very new to Android .... but loving it ! 
However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.

Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.
Try this: The lets it run over any file (incredibly dangerous!) but the revision specifier limits it to the specific files included in that changelist.

Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
You could also group the characters by language. Load each language table as needed, and when you need to switch languages, unload the previous language table and load the new one.

Guy's I am at my wit's end. I've got a VPS that I'm mucking around on, so nothing is important, but nginx is being a complete pain. I've deleted all of the content inside and restarted.

I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.

A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.

Suggest adding the following to Peek and Pop(): if ((_stack.Count - 1) < 0) throw new Exception("Cannot Peek or Pop without first doing a Push.");. This would alert the programmer to this corner case, and allow them to keep it in mind when using this class. We could also add a TryPeek or TryPop, which is the approach Microsoft have taken with their ConcurrentDictionary implementations.

Calling a virtual function is slightly slower than calling a nonvirtual function. However, I don't think it matters how deep your inheritance tree is. But this is not a difference that you should normally be worried about.
I have a lot of classes and this is a lot of work to do the XML mappings.
While your basic point is correct , the code you ' ve shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question : Afaik , you get four ` int ` in one cache line , that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data ( not considering prefetching ) , you have conditional jumps in your loop ( modern architectures hate mispredicting those ) , so you get much , much more than a cycle for each loop iteration . I ' d wager , your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles , probably more , but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping ( how many mispredictions are made ) . 
Oh, I'm sorry, I was unclear.

After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem?

Same thing with writing the Document to a string and parsing it back in. Any ideas? By the way, I'm stuck at Java 1.4.2, for reasons beyond my control.
sounds desirable behaviour to me ! How do you make it do that again ? ! ?

I use ApexSQL Diff. It is an excellent tool for doing just what you're describing...compare schema, compare data, generate change scripts. It not free, but it works well. NOTE: ApexSQL Diff only works with SQL Server.
StyleCop has rules that seem to differ from MS's prior style guides. For example, StyleCop hates m_ and _ for prefixs to private members. Also, the VS default code generation violates StyleCop by putting using statements outside the namespace. *sigh*
I have a serious problem which I can't a solution to. I need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app, the problem is that even though I'm using the AsyncTask, and probably because of it, I can't authenticate it in time.

I have found Html Helpers extremely useful to simplify view pages code. Apart from the ones included in the latest release of Asp.Net Mvc which one do you use? How much you can reuse them in different projects and are they linked only to html generation or did you put some custom logic inside?

I'm using the theme library to draw some text which works absolutely fine on Windows Vista - however, on Windows XP the returned HTHEME is NULL. This is the code I'm using: hTheme is valid on Vista, but NULL on Windows XP. I've read the documentation for and on MSDN, but nothing mentions that TEXTSTYLE isn't supported on XP (even Google doesn't throw up any good suggestions).
Okay , I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code / an appropriate link to wikipedia . You are confusing the entropy of the model ' s probability distribution with the cross entropy ( or likelihood ) of the predictions it makes on real data . Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else . It has 0 entropy , but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn ' t a purely non - random sequence , assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen .

Hi there, I was able to set the focus back on the selected item after some research on similar issue. All i needed to do was, call the BeginInvoke method on the Dispatcher property of the Listbox and do the focus setting on the selecteditem in the listbox in the delegate method call which is as below: box.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(DispatcherPriority.System.Idle, new focus(SetFocus),box); Where focus is the delegate and SetFocus is the delegate method where i get the selected item from the listbox and set focus on the corresponding listboxitem. Hope this helps!! Regards, Sowmi

In my personal opinion , I would make theUILabels as properties of the UIView , so option 2 . You can then access them from the view easily through the controller .

hi guys I am trying to create a program to allow a user to input a sequence of brackets (one at a time) and check to see whether there is a corresponding ending bracket.

Using NSIS is great ( i use it too ) but i would suggest using a " packager " pyinstaller ( my personal fav , alternatives bb _ freeze , py2exe ) to create an exe before the using NSIS The primary benefit you get by doing this is ; Your download is smaller as you ' re not bundling the whole Python Standard Lib and extra stuff your app wont need and you get an exe file to boot !

It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.

With an you would get different results for and , but that class is clearly documented as violating the general contract of maps: This class is not a general-purpose Map implementation! While this class implements the Map interface, it intentionally violates Map's general contract, which mandates the use of the equals method when comparing objects. This class is designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality semantics are required. For normal Map implementations there is no problem with using string keys.

When running graphics based programs in Python for S60 (PyS60) the error messages and the output of the print statement (i.e. stdout) are hidden. If due to an error application stops working as expected its lost and tracking down the bug is very difficult, sometimes require running a "second stripped version" of the code. This is obviously painful. How do I log those errors to a file, so that I may see them later.

I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters . My question is this : can you limit the length of a TEXT field ( VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can ' t use it ) to 512 characters ? If I do that , will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length , or does it act a bit VARCHAR in that the length can vary ? I don ' t have a table ( at all ) yet , but I ' m very conscious about speed and size for the future . I found this article : incredibly useful - maybe you will to ! Thanks a lot , James 
amazing. this app is perfection. 5.0 is insane.
Is there a VB6 equivalent to the C/C++ 'continue' keyword? In C/C++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto. (Ugh!)
I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.
Excellent! Thank you for the follow-up. I added a variation above.
Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality (including history-aware interactivity) on an MVC page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire. The only alternative I see, to require the using page to track each components query-string state, is horrible.
In my case sometimes begins work after "Source Control/Update". Actually, its terrible bug, you have no guarantees that you see actual list!!!

Is it possible to use Twitter's API to grab search results? For example, if I wanted my page to show all tweets (man I hate that term) with the word "cat" in it? Is it also possible to get just the matching results that were after a certain date?
I had the same problem and I ended up doing this: The idea is that I can use heredoc without extremely ugly array formatting.
Always open in my editor is a tab with a text version of MySQL ' s manual ( ~ 100k lines in a readable layout ) , which is extremely helpful . The version I have is very old ( when 5.0 was still in beta ) , and this valuable text - file does not exist in mysql . com anymore . Is there a newer version , or some tool that can create it out of the various existing formats ? 
It's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!
Wow ! I have an idea of cool web 2.0 app , and i will share it with you now .

Thanks! This looks very promising!
Cool. sounds good to me.
I hate it none of the specified answers worked for me....
I loved the wild solution that Marcus offered and it would be great if it could be undeleted!
I personally mark most methods and properties virtual. I use proxies and lazy loading alot, so I don't want to have to worry about changing things at a later date.
They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.

Are there any tools to assist with the internationalization of Strings within JSP files? Most IDEs (for example, ) offer such a feature for Java code. However, in the case of NetBeans, no such feature exists for JSP files. With , for example, there is are various tools out there that assist with extracting text Strings from code. Something similar for JSP would be great!
Shit, there is an dependency. Please go to Preferences -> LDAP -> Entry Editor and enable the option "Show operational attributes".
I was intending on use the Title attribute in the @Page directive to customise each pages title, but it simply doesn't appear to do anything. The site uses master pages - I don't know if that is a consideration. Master Page snippet: Page snippet (from ): What is more, if I run the page through the , it complains about... end tag for "head" which is not finished ..whereas the the tag is present in the source code. I've already got a workaround in place, but it's annoying the hell out of me, so I'm determined to find a resolution!
You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.

The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).
It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.
If your worried about other people access your web service directly, you could check the calling IP address and host header and make sure it matches expected IP's addresses. If your worried about people stealing information during it's journey from the server to the client, SSL is the only way to go.

Per : https : / / support . google . com / googleplay / android - developer / answer / 3131213 ? hl = enYou need to be registered as a member of a Google + or Google Group that is designated for Beta or Alpha testing by the Developer . If you are not registered , you will only be able to download the production app from Google Play , NOT the Beta or Alpha version of the app from Google Play . Having the " link " won ' t be sufficient , you need to opt - in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group . Please note that even if you properly opt - in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer , you will need to wait several hours ( perhaps 2 - 8 hours ) for your status to propagate via Google Play .

I'm receiving a recovery feed from an exchange for recovering data missed from their primary feed. The exchange strongly recommends listening to the recovery feed only when data is needed, and leaving the multicast once I have recovered the data I need. My question is, if I am using asio, and not reading from the NIC when I don't need it, what is the harm? The messages have sequence numbers, so I can't accidentally process an old message "left" on the card. Is this really harming my application?
I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.

If you really worry about the performance, divide the page content into separate section and run the search process parallel !!!
ROT13. It's super efficient too!
I ' m not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you ' d like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references ( strong , weak , soft , phantom ) in java . Also remember that pre - optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming . 
I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
updated the answer. This might help you! Great! then you might want to edit the java program and have the permission specified while the folder is created did you try chmod with 777 permission via terminal or php?
excellent! glad to hear it!

Awesome!!! You just saved me a LOT of work!!! Wish I could give more than just an upvote!!!
Unless you're writing code for a really critical inner loop (simulator core, ray-tracer, etc.) there is no point in worrying about any performance hits in this case. There are other more important things to worry about in your code (and other more significant performance traps lurking, I'm sure).

You would probably be much better off "exporting" the code to where you want to run it, so you don't have all those .svn folders lying around on your web server.

I'm convinced that this is a combination of Windows and Vcl issues. If I understand correctly, Vcl is using outdated Windows API calls for printers, which leads to these issues. The problem is in Windows its self, but the only reason Vcl suffers this problem is because it's using outdated Windows API calls. If the Vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods, this problem presumably wouldn't happen. At least this is my hunch.
Do you need to worry about hitting the server with too many requests at once?
Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience, the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time, when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?
I don't know the answer to this question, but the book "Understanding the Linux Kernel" has a lot of good information on this type of stuff. It's a really great book, anyone doing kernel work should read it.

@NWest You can use a `@table` variable, which is immune from transaction rollbacks, to not need all kinds of heinous workarounds.

I'm trying to compile code that I know to be working on other peoples' machines but is throwing a particular error on my system. Specifically the error relates to the printf() method The method printf(String, Object[]) in the type PrintStream is not applicable for the arguments (String, double) For instance Does anyone know why this error is cropping up? There are alternatives to using printf(), but this is very annoying!
The dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again ! When you calculate ( ( 3 + 2 + 1 ) / 100 ) , since all the operands are integers , Ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic . If you do 7 / 100 it will also return 0 , as it ' s rounded down to the nearest integer , which is 0 . 
you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.
Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.

You DO need to modify web . xml whenever it ' s needed . Especially with JAX - RS , you will have to define your servlet in web . xml . I recommand you to use Maven . There are plenty of exemple in the web to do so . Good luck , JAX - RS is really great ! Maven is also nice . 
I am not familiar with the instance manager, but I have used on several systems (including a remotely hosted server) with great success. It supports MySQL 5.0 and 4.1.
who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?
Thanks a lot, Jon for signing up this.
Instead of this just use . THis will help you to come back to the previous activity . As per your code , the application was completely killed . 
I'm trying to create a small snippet to allow the onloaded image to be adjusted to fit the users resolution. And then allow the user to toggle between the actual image size, and the adjusted image size for their resolution. Here's what I got so far: Any help is greatly appreciated!
this worked excellently, great job! :)
after some tests i found a fast solution , you can add in top of your index page: it work very fine :)
Jonathan's comment sums up my feeling. In EF4, char(1) fields come across as string, so MS obviously recognized the pain.
The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).
When you submit a form, does the button that was clicked get posted also?
It would be cooler if you could
Thanks for that - I figured that was probably the best solution. Very good answer too!
It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.
Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.
Maybe do a setTimeout for the length of the video and fire an event once the length of the video has passed. Try this to detect when the window loses focus: If you're really worried about the accuracy of setTimeout, maybe try this:
I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: Vista, PHP 5.2.9, PHPUnit 3.4, PHPUnderControl, CruiseControl
Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?
I'm pretty sure you want a datetime or timestamp column in that table, too: I can't imagine a variant of the app you describe where it would be irrelevant WHEN a status update was posted!
Distinct is in Linq, not System.Collections.Generic as reported by the MSDN page.
It may suck, but at least *I* won't be the one bringing in a dumb dependency to a logging library.
I've never come across native support for this (although that'd be pretty awesome), but there *might* be a plugin (or you could write it yourself!).
But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.
Great question ! I also find myself a little lost in WPF because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts , layout , spacing , colors , etc .

In addition to firebug ( which should be your first port of call ) , the will also tell you where a given style is sourced from , just in case IE - shock , horror - should be different . 
huh ... i thought i did resolve this.
Drama-free and practical. +1.
Wow that was exactly what I wanted ! So the second solution I showed is somewhat similar to what he ' s describing but he describes also extremely elegant triggers that would keep all the data fully sane without any external code sanitization ! I think I will go with that design ! 
Short answer : no , there is no way for your application to be aware ( for instance with an event that is raised ) that its hosting process has been brutally killed . 
Tried some more stuff and realized I was doing it wrong.
Pull it back in if you think different.
What makes you think it can't?
Apart from the books available from , I am looking for some links to any resources that could help in learning the VTK library. Preferably, with example code and tutorials. Google results have not been terribly informative for me. So I am asking here for links to VTK resources.
PHPExcel, so you did wrote that library. Excellent! For now max entries of CSV is 100,000 for a test. Maybe I lurk around with it if you introduce how to do that? thanks
Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed , I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!

Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.
That's very sad and the issue was opened a year ago...
Your implementation looks absolutely fine to me! A range-based away subscript is a type for performance reasons. It does not copy the indicated sub-array, instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript.
I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.
I think it should be a warning . Generally speaking , the common rule is that ' you should treat warnings as errors ' . If I unintentionally write unreachable code , I will see it in the warnings , and fix it anyway . However , sometimes , Neil says , you intentionally create dead code , for debugging purposes or whatever reason . I ' d really , really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that . 
i have: how can i get the innerHTML of the child of "td1" ? dosen't work.
According to the documentation in VB6 the Mid function returns a variant, but Mid$ returns a string and apparently this is more efficient. My questions are : What simple test can I use to discern the difference in performance ? I tried looking at simple app which did a few string operations, with , but there was no discernible difference. Is it worth worrying about? I've gotten into the habit of using the $-ized functions, but should I recommend everybody on my team to use it as well ?
Great question ! ! I ' m hoping to use something migrations with Django too . 
Theoretically if you wrap the functions of each file in a separate class then you can call them both without problems. You don't even need to really worry about class state if you call them statically.
Oh wow! That does an excellent work! Thank you!
Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.

From my own experience, Microsoft SQL Compact Framework is a REAL NO-GO. It is REALLY FREAKING slow and its Query Analyzer is just really poor. I had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my Windows Mobile component to get rid of the awful performances of SQL CE.
Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.
use an CODE_FRAGMENT and add a FILE_NAME if not in there already.
This question is awfully vague.. and doesn't seem to have anything to do with programming..
I would like to strip everything in a string before a - and leave what ' s after that . For example : 15.11 - 101 I want to strip 15.11 and leave 101 . I ' ve tried a few different things , but can ' t seem to get it working , if anyone could help me out , that ' d be fantastic : ) Cheers Leanne 
For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.

Take a look at . Bear in mind that running both side by side is not supported by Microsoft ( ) and there ' s no guarantee that they will work absolutely fine side by side - a Windows Update could easily break something and sometimes people find conditional comments don ' t work properly amongst other things .

Excellent, I'm glad that worked for you!
It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables( hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables, not a shit load).
you have to use symlinks instead of an alias... sad there is no ui for that! you have to go into the Terminal and type: the first PATH is the base path of the original file and the second is for the base path for the symlink of the file/folder etc

I have a bunch of .NET frameworks installed on my machine. I know that with the Java JDK, I can use the 6.0 version to target 5.0 and earlier. Can I do something similar with the .NET framework - target 1.0 and 2.0 with the 3.0 framework?
We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the "Tip of the day" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?
But it isn't working like I expected.
If you're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the Windows division at Microsoft, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They don't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the .

If DevStudio is crashing a lot on you, you might try uninstalling any add-ins and extensions as a first step. It might save you a lot of pain.
great job! this is a super app  very useful and user friendly  easily personalized and adjustable. it works for me anyway. helps you stay on track and see how much time you are spending or wasting. if you forget to start it or want/need to input an activity/event you are tracking time for  it's easily done manually. "notes" space is useful for more detail/info associated with a specific day's task. so many ways this can be used to track time spent on tasks and projects for business  personal  family  pleasure  etc.

I've got all 3 of them in the same project group, all set up to output to the same custom BPL output folder. This folder is in the search path for B and C. But when I go to build B and C, the compiler chokes on the Requires list. "Required package 'A' not found." How do I tell B and C where to find A so they'll build correctly?

I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.
This is a horrible solution . It will silently fail for floats . It also lacks parentheses .

Though be aware that if the starting string is all upper case, you have to call `String.ToLower` first, since `ToTitleCase` doesn't work on all upper case strings.

Anti-JavaScript snobbery! Every language uses a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code. JavaScript is just another language, capable of writing "programs" or "scripts".
To convert raster images to vectorial images, I found (free) to do an excellent job (comparable to VectorMagic, which is not free anymore by the way). In Inkscape, import your image and use the Path/Trace Bitmap function. It has a lot of control. Once you converted to a vectorial image, save it as a SVG. Then, using , you can convert to XAML vector data. (Path & Canvas)
I know you can have pre and post build events at a project level, but I want to stop and start a service at the beginning and end of a build of the solution -- i.e. when I do a 'Build Solution' the service is stopped and the last action of the build is to re-start the service. There are no build events on the solution property page, so what should I do? I'm guessing that I can add tasks to the msbuild file but I'm afraid I don't understand the relationship between VS and msbuild at all. Does VS execute msbuild with the SLN file?
The biggest problem is that we've had too many committers over the years and we'd have to get all of their permission to change it.

I think what he means is, you can't just read: myService.DoSomething() and go to the definition of DoSomething, because with IoC, myService is just an interface, and the actual implementation is unknown to you, unless you go look it up in xml config files or the main method where your ioc gets setup.
CODE_FRAGMENT creates a capturing group, to be referenced later.
To add something to this ( cause I found it while searching on this problem , and my solution involved slightly more ) ... If you don ' t have a " Browse with ... " option for . aspx files ( as I didn ' t in a MVC application ) , the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file , and right - click it to set the option as described in the answer . You can remove the file afterward . The option is actually set in : C : \ Documents and Settings [ user ] \ Local Settings \ Application Data \ Microsoft \ VisualStudio [ version ] \ browser . xml However , if you modify the file directly while VS is running , VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run . Also , if you edit the default in VS you won ' t have to worry about getting the schema right , so the work - around dummy file is probably the easiest way .

Unfortunately the SMBIOS UUID is not unique on all systems. It should be but it isn't. This is not because of a failure in the specification of the SMBIOS UUID, but is due to the fact that many manufacturers don't follow the spec when creating this UUID.

By the way there is another more informative topic on stackoverflow about creating machine unique id's at

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.

Enlightenment DR16 is packaged with openSUSE 11.1 but it's a bit painful to use with KDE apps as there's no obvious (on the Enlightenment site, google etc.) way to provide a systray for KDE apps that require one (e.g., ktorrent). Anyone know of a way around this? I'm not using e for the eye-candy - I'm running on a 2.6GHz Celeron and KDE (4.1) performance isn't exactly stellar so I'm trying out a few alternatives.
Oh, I did not know that. As usual, IE comes out to be a pain in the a**!

Anyone else get this or suffer from this ? I am using Vista and VS 2008 and when I goto open a Web Site it literally takes 2 ~ 3 minutes for the dialog box to show up . Once i actually select a website it ' s not a problem but getting to that point hangs VS really bad . 
average no doubt the art work of the game is original and fits the environment well  but that alone does not make a good title. the gameplay is interesting but lacks a real reason to come back or be played over another game. the split screen in the only feature that stood out but even then it got boring quickly. i liked the game  thought it was promising  but a lack of ideas to keep me playing made the experience fall short.

@ Brian : You will probably agree that a ) it is not a real question as far as grammar is concerned , and b ) that this sentence is a totally buried in the text . You simply might get better answers if you make this a real question . Especially the first paragraph seems completely superfluous . 
The problem is that you wrote.
If you're really worried about string/character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding. It's a layer of headache, especially if you want to do it in memory, and there are plenty of cases in which it wouldn't buy you anything, but encoding, especially, tend to be too general purpose to the level of compactness you seem to be aiming for.

I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an E4X query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList, which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I'm not thinking of that XML and XMLList were designed to only have Object as a common type?
What is the difference between the events vs ? When does each event get hit?

I am currently working on an n-tier system and battling some database performance issues. One area we have been investigating is the latency between the database server and the application server. In our test environment the average ping times between the two boxes is in the region of 0.2ms however on the clients site its more in the region of 8.2 ms. Is that somthing we should be worried about? For your average system what do you guys consider a resonable latency and how would you go about testing/measuring the latency? Karl

You could achieve all this with reflection but it would lead to a really horrible code. You'd better access individual members of the view model:
You should definitely HTML encode before assigning posted content to the HTML body of an email. Your code should already be rejecting content such as '<script>' as invalid, not just in the case of an email but in all cases. There are no other considerations you need to worry about.

Another oddity is the VISUAL mode, and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got, 'soda', maybe. Anyway, I searched and found out you can turn off COMMAND mode by pressing 'i'. Regardless, both of these modes are extremely annoying, how do I get rid of them?

I would not store configuration information in the repository at all. That way you don't have to worry about SVN trying to update the config when you update your source.
Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Don't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and don't optimise prematurely.

If you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image (or your custom object) array instead of putting it in a local variable.

Then set . Then remove timer (optional but better).

I ' d like to have the " large icon " view display the icon that Windows Explorer uses for that filetype , otherwise I ' ll have to use some existing code this : The above code returns an integer that is used to select an icon from an imagelist that I populated with some common icons . It works fine but I ' d need to add every extension under the sun ! Is there a better way ? Thanks !

I'm absolutely staggered by the amazing response I've received in the last 10 minutes! Thankyou all so much for your answers. Very, very helpful.
If it's managed (i.e. part of the framework) you don't need to worry about it. If it implements IDisposable just wrap it in a block. If you want to use unmanaged resources then you need to read up on finalisers and implementing IDisposable yourself. There's a lot more detail under
Maybe, but that's not what he asked. He was worried instead about losing a pointer to that particular location in memory, which is a dubious concept in Python anyhow.
I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.
It may cause conflicts, but if your intent is to break system security, you probably don't care.
I am pretty sure this can help! Cheers!
The issue comes into play if you color a div, and set its opacity to make it transparent. If you then want to put text on this div, the text is transparent, and that isn't always desirable.
The A in XAMPP stands for Apache. If you don't have a extremely good reason to use IIS, don't use it!

I have VS2005 installed. But I was afraid about installing VS2008 and lose everything. I think I have to install 3.5 framework first. Is that correct?
Bear in mind, that the above code might not compile ( I haven't tried it out myself... ).
I did a lot of VRML + Java work in college and loved it , but I feel it ' s not really a marketable skill .

As was noted in the comments the link is: He particularly piqued my interest with this quote: "... in certain cases, you are simply better off working on getting more data, then spending your time on improving the algorithm..." Excellent presentation and presenter ()! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start down the path of machine learning.
Awesome!! Thanks :)
There is an excellent example of how to implement your own two-dimensional ArrayList and (re-) use it in your specific case: No need to reinvent the wheel, go for it!
Great answer! If I may update it to Rails 3, the json method now seems to be to_json. At least that's what worked for me... i.e. @contact.to_json
malicious users don't just exist "out there" on the internet - most of them have jobs in corporations and you are probably working with a couple of them right now - there is a reason that all user accounts and physical access are the first things you cut off when you fire someone

Not really, no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I didn't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of Controls and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail.
It crashes only one time and then it works normally. Here is the project:
The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.
Does anybody have a simple code to display a list (list view?) of all the apps installed on a phone, and have the user open one when clicked? Or even an App drawer. I just need a way to have the user open all of their apps. I have tried searching for tutorials, but couldn't find any, and I downloaded the example home from Android, but I absolutely hate looking through code and digging out what I Want.
Since I was also looking for a way to use the empty word epsilon I came up with the following approach. I simply used an empty production rule such as: Hope it works - at least for now it seems so ... Addendum: It works pretty fine :)
Oh, how I hate TFS for giving me these headaches!
there is room for improvement... the good thing  it lets you know when your moga (pro) has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller. the bad thing: a.its interface. it's boring  even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone-based stylish themed or better. b.the bluetooth connection. when i'm using the game  the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect;or it happens for a few seconds and while i'm using the controller  my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet. c.the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device  but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life? how much longer can my controller's built-in battery last? it should let me know. d.just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller. i'm talking about pivot running in the background  self-updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the 'supported games' list. it'd be great. e.sometimes the controller takes too long to connect. what's with the hold up? please fix these issues. they are worth a new update.

How do I change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in Tapestry 5? I have column names of different lengths and I break lines on spaces, so the button, which is appended to the end of the column names, always ends up in different height. And that is very ugly :(
here is my code i keep getting
I then click on the button but I get this error message.
I know this doesn't answer your question directly, but it might be worth checking out the SQL Server 2005 migration tool for Access. I've never used the tool, but it might be worth using with SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to see if there are the same issues as you had with MySQL
Awesome co-op. Thanks, Robert & Mike, for picking this up.
And on what platform? (HTML, Winforms, VB.NET) ?
The .NET installation is one of the most painful setups of all history, in all means possible. I've did many such setups and about half of them even *crashed* for XP.
I have installed python and don't really know what this means. Any ideas?
Excellent question! There doesn't appear to be a control in Eclipse to do it, but these two blog entries: both say it can be done in the windows registry. Caveat: I have not tried this.
Also, your username was stupidly named and confusing, so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.
So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!
First of all I can ' t see object locking , unused lockObject variable makes me sad . IEnumerable is not special . Each thread will have it ' s own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object . You can ' t affect other threads that way . What would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party . 
I agree. It's clear that you are on the threshold of either using a library or writing your own. Go get jQuery and just use it as you see fit in your project, starting with this. Here's to happier days!
excellent! exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Anna.
I would go the custom Attached property route! should be pretty simple to implement too!
Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.
Doesn't the CLR automatically release any unreleased mutexes when the application terminates anyway?
A related question: Have you faced the issue of making the same code work with 2005 and 2008. If yes, how did you solve it?
So I need to get a quotient to 2 decimal places 0.33 , but do I need to use doubles all the way down or can I use integers for everything except the quotient and then just use double or decimal for the quotient ? It is also breaking because of the quotient . If anyone could help me I would be extremely grateful : ) 
What I need to know is if adding custom classes and properties to the IIS metabase schema will cause any running app pools to restart or sessions to be killed off ?

Perhaps you could deserialise the byte array using a known encoding and ensure that (a) it doesn't throw any exceptions, and (b) deserialises to the original string. It seems that from your description of the scenario, you may not have the original string readily available. Might there be a way to create it?
Sorry that I think I missed some discussion in the mailing list.
Check here for an example which returns a String.
It seems, that there must be some problem when genereting the response.

Just a word of advice - this will be painful to extend if you later want to add a proper user - login system , and / or a threaded reply structure .

Mono appears to have really come a log way since the last time I really used it . I ' m interested in doing some ASP . Net development using Mono . I have used . netTiers / CodeSmith at work and really enjoy the speed with which code generation gives you a clean working data access layer . The question is has anybody used any code generation with Mono ? I am open to learning something SubSonic or NHibernate if those work better with Mono . Thanks in advance for any help . 
Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.

Assets are bundled with your APK and they are read only. You cannot delete them in your app.If you're really worried about storage usage, consider alternative database distribution mechanisms such as downloading it over the network.
We are working in real estate project, there we have image and video uploads in many places. We are started with in few places, But now we found an issue that it does not work if the flash player not installed in the browser. Its working only after installed the flash player in browser. This is really worrying. We should not force user to install flash player to upload images/video. How to handle this issue?
Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.
Thanks, after using it for a couple of hours, I can say that's a great soft, definitely!
If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?
The point of the require_once function is that no matter the scope, you won't include a file twice and redefine a class causing a PHP error. So no worries about memory leaks, if the require_once is hit, the class def goes in the global symbol table only one time. But aside from that, yeah use autoloader.
great app.. nice app .. keep it up..  it is very useful app for us... *****
If I have a simple piece of data to store (an integer or string for example) I might choose to store that in ViewState, or using a HiddenField control. Why would I choose one over the other? ViewState Hard for the user to decode (thought not impossible), which might be desirable HiddenField Value can be used in JavaScript Are there other pros and cons?
This is a really great DBGrid ! Just give it a try , you will not regret it . 
Is there anywhere I can download a SWF fo sIFR 3 of the Rockwell font ( the one that comes with sIFR 3 ) , but with a bunch of special characters embedded too ? Specifically the pound sign ( Â £ ) , but more would be great : ) I don ' t have access to Flash right now and I ' ve tried the automatic tools but with little success . I ' ve looked everywhere , does anyone have any pointers ? Many thanks ! 
Check out GSON for converting POJOs to JSON: We've been using for a couple of years now. Very excellent library. For POJOs to XML, Jersey uses JAXB or you could roll your own serializer.
You can download a local copy of jQuery or use a CDN. This link has details: http://jquery.com/download/
Doing it at the hackathon you'd have a few fellas at your shoulder to give you pointers should you get stuck.
works excellent!! thanks a lot guys!!!
I didn't know that. I always thought it was AND.
Somewhere on the web there is a blog post which is just a lot of scrum boards . It is really good to see how other people do it . Maybe someone can find it for us : ) I think this looks a pretty comprehensive way of doing things ! 
Pretty new to this scene and trying to find some documentation to adopt best practices . We ' re building a fairly large content site which will consist of various media catalogs and I ' m trying to find some comparable data / architectural models so that we can get a better idea of the approach we should use using a framework we ' ve never made use of before . Any insight / help would be greatly appreciated ! 
I really hate regex in principle. can it be done in a plane script or something?
Overall bytes includes those that have been released and is a running total of what has been allocated to your app during the lifetime of the app . The Live Bytes is the one to really worry about as that is the one that shows bytes that are currently allocated . Overall bytes could keep going on forever as long as you release stuff and the Live Bytes doesn ' t go too high then you will have no problems . From that screenshot live bytes looks ok . There are more details here 
As said by Gawie below, this is all mapped to a command named "View.ShowSmartTag". Instead of using an uncomfortable shortcut, you can find the command and remap it to something that makes sense to you!
what about 3rd question?( When is it appropriate and when not?)
just love it! been using for 9 months now and it is perfect app! ?
As Alexander said, you are comparing a string and a char. The sad thing is that the compiler already told you that, only it encrypted it in ISO-STL-TEMPLATE encryption, which is more difficult to read that perl! You may want to look at for decrypting C++ STL error messages.
Its a little complicated, there is a full example in this loadNativeLibrary ( ) method.
Here is an incredibly disgusting way to do it: Here is a better way (I think): If you convert either output string with: you get your original number.
app is slow it it not well organized the categories like shooters there is only one witch is incorrect and its slow it freezes scrolling is glitchy etc.
I know I can configure command line arguments in the Run configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It's a pain to change the Run Configuration every time. Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?
Sorry, Thiru, I hope you haven't already started working on this!
I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.
You can use the Japura API. There is a List component with checkboxes [http://www.japura.org/checklist.html](http://www.japura.org/checklist.html)
Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic "anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
I should add that the element thing throws an error when it can't find something. Do you normally use try/except for all find_element commands? * oh so very sad * :(
Sigh, I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.
FYI, if your test needs so much setup that you need a 'helper' class, you're going to have pain and friction down the line.
Any ideas for why this happens?
That tests if the highest bit in a 32 bit integer is set, not what was required.

Yeah - my solution to this was to limit IE users - they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that FX and Chrome users can. Even then IE8 only just copes with maybe 25 cells (5x5 grid), 7 and 6 remain hopeless. It brings back memories of late 90s web development and is an ugly thing to do, but what else can you do if their browser is so poor?
Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S
Thanks for the feedback! It was a pleasure!
Not that I recommend this, but totally abusing LINQ the following would work:
Is it possible to re - open an . xcarchive file on Xcode ? I know this is not common , but I would like to open a project exactly as it was submitted to the App Store .

For all your keydown/keyup/keyboard needs, use the jQuery hotkeys plugin. Saw this a few months ago and it never fails to impress it. Follow the jump for the plugin demo ... It maps ALL keys on a keyboard including combos. Hope it helps!
I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.
You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph, i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different, as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The "background" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible, horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox. Folks, how do I do it?
You are very welcome! Learn programming, it's a lot of fun!
The clue is : If you actualy have defined the table , then you have suffered the major ( probably only ! ) sqlite gotcha . If the database file doesnt exits it will quietly create an empty database for you . Double check you file path and look for a new empty sq3 file appearing in your directory . 
pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.

very nice. great keyboard app. many great tools and a ton of customization.
You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.

I have a need to explore VOIP integration into a .Net application. It would be incredibly helpful if the toolset was usable via ASP.Net (version 2.0 or higher), and provided the developer the option to allow interaction on the client either embedded within the web browser or external to the client web browser. It should be compatible at a minimum with Internet Explorer, but would be better if browser independence were an option.
I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.
The only way I've found to do this is using the plugin hoverIntent:
i think by using this code you can have a limited size queue..which is also Circular buffer.

I'm not for sure how the ControlCollection of ASP.Net works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and Linq. Well, I was very sad to find that this isn't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why doesn't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:

If you're really worried about that, make an NSTimer that fires in say 5 seconds, and send traffic when it fires. Invalidate the timer when your view disappears.
Also, your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around. I think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot.

Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.
Effective, but what a pain! You'd think there'd be an easier way.
This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.
I ' m working with a console application ( C # ) at the moment . What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine . At the moment , every time I run the console app , it pulls ALL the files from the database . What I would like to be able to do , is each time I run it , It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application . Currently , this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database . Ideally I ' d something the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere : I ' m unsure on how to go about achieving this . If anyone had any advice on it I ' d be very greatful : ) 
@StoneFree welcome to the future brave time traveller! :o)
The answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call. So in order for jQuery to do this properly I add this : where is a global variable. Unfortunately, I have to write this extra line on every single ajax call. Terrible! Maybe I'll edit the jQuery framework to handle this..
I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application : When a user selects a table view cell , the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating . I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can ' t quite seem to find any good resources . How can I accomplish this ? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful !

The first statement seems to pull back everything from the DB and then the second statement gets a subset. What if you just want a subset in the first place? I have 90,000 rows and just want page 4 of 10 rows.
I am looking at moving my company ' s internal business app from VB . NET to PHP . Some of the people were worried about losing GUI features that can be found in . NET . I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework , anything in . NET GUI can be replicated . While I am still researching this point , I would like to ask if form features in . NET GUI can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly , will it take much longer to develop to get the same results ? 
No, I'm afraid not! You can call yourself in a js-function from . codebehind:
no worries! You should answer your own question, so others in future know what the issue was.
@MikeChristensen that's horrible :| and weird!!
The patch should be relatively trivial, but alike I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.
This is probably caused because you have set to (Which is absolutely terrible). (See ) You should disable register globals so that the SESSION/POST/GET/REQUEST/COOKIE variables do not interfere.
I really love the " one model in - one model out " idea of Fubu MVC . A controller would look something this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor . This makes the controller very easy to test .

I ' m using some modifications to Glenn Berry ' s excellent DMV queries ! However , I would like to add to the resultset the ' last server restart ' , or to be more specific , the date / time the statistics for ( all , the specific ) DMV was reset . Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics , I want to make absolutely sure the date / time is accurate and shown . Question : How can you get the most accurate date / time of when a / all DMV statistic was reset ? Thanks ! - D 
hI, I'm trying to get this code from Larry Nyhoff's book to compile in Bloodshed. It's actually been taken word for word from the author's website, though I declared it on .cpp instead of .h (the .h file ain't working with the tester application). The search(const DataType & item) function is what's giving me grief. The compiler error says: What I'm I missing here?

I often need to execute custom sql queries in django, and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful. I wonder how fellow Slackers deal with this. Maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom SQL in Django?

What may be the problem in this ? ? Even i have increased the size of the destination folder . But still i am getting this error . Why i am getting the Unknown Bytes error . 
I decided to simplify the reply marked as the answer on here to basically 2 lines using a LINQ expression.
Because the table design is wrong. If it can't be changed, that's short-sightedness and you'll have to suffer by using sub-optimal SQL. A table change is a one-time cost which can be amortized, sub-optimal queries cost every time you use them.
I would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons. Premature optimization can be dangerous. Premature database de-normalization can be disastrous! I would suggest that you stick with the original schema and later, if necessary, create a reporting table that is a de-normalized version of your normalized schema.
Do you have any hints to avoid this error?
@ joe Yes , if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above , but I don ' t explicitly declare an ivar myself , the compiler will still actually create the ivar . So I could do ` int len = [ self . stringProperty length ] ` as you ' d expect inside the class , AND I can also do ` int len = [ stringProperty length ] ` as well , without using the accessor method , just directly using the ivar ( which the compiler has synthesized for me , along with setter + getter ) . It ' s really fantastic !

I did this the other day and it worked fine, but I don't seem to be able to duplicate it ... please advise. }
Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?
CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.

great potential. great start. a week ago i replaced my razr with the note 3. i really miss "smart actions" by motorola. this app needs a lot more triggers and actions. i rarely use a headset and when i plug in the charger all i need it to do is charge the battery. all i use now is the time to silence the phone as needed. could use location  network and speed (for care mode) triggers . i sincerely hope the developer continues to add features. once it's up to speed i wouldn't mind paying for it.

There are two issues with your regex pattern : Firstly , you forgot to add the ^ at the beginning . this is why only the last characters were checked , or to say : you did not check the entire input . Secondly , your cyrill check did not seem to be correct . Still , I am not used to cyrillic letters and I should be careful before I judge ; ) hope it helps !

My company has no current plans to move to vista, so we haven't tested compatability issues yet. Doug Hennig has an excellent article on the subject however: These links describe some issues as well:
The most correct/idiomatic solution (if you cannot avoid having a collection to begin with) is to use an : Putting the into a lambda isn't going to make anything any easier. In fact, it'll only create more work.Of course if you really hate using an you can avoid it, not that it'll really help you much: You could emulate the more functional style concept with a method that invokes an action if the object isn't , not that this is really any easier than a check when dealing with actions instead of functions:

I just got through this exact problem. What a pain! If you are running a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Windows, make sure that you set the execution policy for the 32-bit Powershell interface.

We use Hessian in our software, and I wish the previous developers didn't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from C++. It's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple HTTP xml or json.
A container is a concept in IoC where the object model, including dependencies (relationships between "user" object and "used" object) and object instances, reside and is managed -- e.g., contained. The container is usually provided by a IoC framework, such as Spring. Think of it as a runtime repository for the objects that make up your application.
Wow, you are right, thanks! I'll accept Brians' answer.

@grieve: Networking is native, meaning that when buffers are used the receive/send data on the network, they are pinned in memory. see my comments below for elaboration.
What technologies are you using? You can write direct to Word 2007+ (.docx) as it's basically just a zip file with XML in it (in an awful and poorly documented format, but never mind). If you're using the older binary format then it all depends on which 3rd-party tool you're using to write to document.

holy crap i lack the words to describe just how amazing this is on 4.1+. seriously  i've tried to explain it to people who haven't used it  and i just can't. i fail as an orator.  pretty pointless on older android versions though. although i have to wonder what the typical 1 star trolls are going on about battery use. the amount of my battery this uses is almost nonexistent. and complaining that an optional opt-in feature is running in the background when its entire purpose is to run in the background is just stupid.

Pretty self explanatory question . I just don ' t know how to do it . I ' ve been using Eclipse for about a month so I still have a lot to learn . I ' m using the newest version of eclipse Juno and need to push the app ( or email it ) to my MyTouch . How would I do it from eclipse , as that is the way I would prefer ?

I have a main flash from wich i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a "main.swf?version2" but i can't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
I personally only use the 'm' and the 'p'. The rest is just zany in my view. It makes the code so darn hard to decipher. I did maintenance work on this guy's code who used semi-Hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable, function, and other identifier in the code. He used $ signs liberally to separate words. It was hard to keep the murderous rage in check.
While this is excellent advice, as other answers state, there is a more nuanced answer in the case of an immutable, safely published map instance. But you should do that only if You Know What You're Doing.
Okay, so given the overwhelmingly negative response, does anybody think db image storage is _ever_ justified?

I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head... How to add my own events (of my own applications) in the Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Sounds -> Program Events?

I have a function name called setValue, used in many classes. Also, i have a global function by the same name. When i press C-], it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global.

Everytime I execute my app in debug mode , the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that I ' m using . Even though it ' s a NullPointerException , for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution . In case you ' re curious , I ' ve put the stacktrace below . My problem though is that I simply want to stop that . It ' s extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution . But I can ' t find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files . How do I avoid this ? 
Hehe this is nothing compared to some other little adventures I had with them ^_^" ... I love them *^o^*!!
Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.
It depends on your OS, CPU, Compiler, and possibly other factors. In general it means the CPU bus could not complete a command, or suffered a conflict, but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run.
yeah it working fine :) Thanks !!
Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page... I wish I could vote +5.
I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered, , none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm, and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?
If the answer was a snake , I could have been killed by it , its already in front of me !

Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size (say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this shouldn't even be noticeable by your users.
logically , each " master " entity should be in its own table if you don ' t , you ' ll find joins will become very painful , and your generic lookup table will accumulate all kinds of useless fields 
Great time saver and hidden gem. Excellent!
I ' m just working my way through Django , and really liking it so far , but I have an issue and I ' m not sure what the typical way to solve it . Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex Python object is updated , but this object is not driven by the database , say it is driven by AJAX calls or directly by the user or something . Where does this code go ? Should it still go in models . py ? ? ? ? 
By clever, I mean NOT TO upload once again the files that has been already uploaded (with the same dates, size or checksum...). It would be great, because the Publish method takes a lot of time!
If I can give you one advice on this one, I'd say this: fuck Derby, use H2 instead as the default embedded database.

There's some debate over that FAQ entry. Yes, by all means, answer your own question. But if you routinely have a set of pre-baked questions and answers, then this site just becomes a blog, rather than an exchange. You have the misfortune of picking a day when someone abused the spirit of that FAQ.

How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
Partition it first, to divide the zeros from the non-zeros. Then sort the rest. Oh, and before worrying about that, profile first!
as was already established, this is a miserable, horrible, awful, and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective. Anyway, since your question is really about Go's type system, here's how you would define a type with a recursive method.

I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.
@GMasucci, I'm not saying that all singletons are evil, I'm saying that they are considered such and for a reason. I myself use them sometimes, but I often find that I would be better of without them. I'm not going to start a flame war about singletons here, but if there is a doubt (otherwise, why ask a question?)... Maybe there's enough of a reason not to use them?

In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.

@mahadev - I would love to help test a patch :) I'm currently using 3.3.1 + ZOOKEEPER-744 + ZOOKEEPER-790, applied in that order.
As a dev I worry about event logs getting full and then hitting an error when logging an error. But I suppose you have to deal with 'logging' failures with whatever you are logging to (file/db).
A (it doesn't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files. The main use for this is to allow a code generator (e.g. a Visual Studio designer) to "own" one file, while hand-written code is put in another. I've no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities, I'm afraid.

If its just the quotes you are worried about, then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library, you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.
A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).
Another thing I hate to see is the : I've seen this in real code.

Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.
Actually this is possible , though extremely difficult ! This post will get you started : 
I completely agree with you on that subject. In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design, procedural code, no encapsulation, production code littered with test code, interfaces everywhere, hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.
I know that IList is the interface and List is the concrete type but I still don ' t know when to use each one . What I ' m doing now is if I don ' t need the Sort or FindAll methods I use the interface . Am I right ? Is there a better way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type ? 
Not only it's the first one in my life I'm seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing, it also conceals programming errors.

Anyone seen this issue when using IE6 and excanvas before ? 
Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.

Could you rewrite the question to reflect that?
The screen which shows whenever i start Netbeans is very annoying, and among the hundreds of options I can't find the one which turns it off?
lint is constantly updated... so why would you want a more recent one. BTW flexelint is lint
Holy complicated-as-shit-algorithm, Batman! The complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we're actually doing is starting to worry me here.
You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.
In the absence of tuples, they're sometimes the cleanest way to do things. I generally hate them, though. F# has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them. Rather than making me deal with parameters, it treats them as methods that return tuples instead. The various methods end up returning two element tuples: It's quite handy, and doesn't make me feel dirty.
Don't want to beat a dead horse, but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea.
Methods that are not ' const ' will most likely change the state of the object . That is exactly the reasoning behind object orientation : you call operations that do stuff , and you don ' t have to worry about the object ' s internal state . 
IIRC , the max baud was effectively limited only by the H / W - I wrote my config to allow up to 1.3 Mb , but I was targeting modems over RS - 232 so 115K was the max that I needed , and likely the max that I ever will . 
Make sure the designer doesn ' t put anything that he thinks is fancy and well animated . Many a times , it becomes a big pain to simulate such effects in ASP . net unless you are a pro with CSS or Javascript . Coordination between designer and developer is a must according to me , so I would prefer to sit close to a designer till the base design of the page is finalized . 
Hate to break the bad news , but SSHClient ( ) already uses threads internally .

Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.
Then, to make matters worse, since the mid-1990's I've been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I'm an amateur.  
It might be questionable, but not a cause for rejection as long as you have a fallback behavior when/if the method can not be found. There are worse abuses that have passed.

You can easily define a comparator for a one-level , so that lookup becomes way less cumbersome. There is no reason of being afraid of that. The comparator defines an ordering of the _Key template argument of the map. It can then also be used for the multimap and set collections. An example:
to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).
thnx man, it works really good, awesome stuff !!!
I agree, I would use two functions. Basically, you have two different use cases, so it makes sense to have two different implementations. I find that the more C++ code I write, the fewer parameter defaults I have - I wouldn't really shed any tears if the feature was deprecated, though I would have to re-write a shed load of old code!
Version 2 of contains a debugger . And it works awesome ! It is still in very early stages , but have helped me several times . Just watch out for bugs ! : ) 
Effectively what needs to happen is that changes I have marked as live or stable needs to be merged with the Live website . This effectively means I don ' t have to worry about accidently copying over files and if something goes wrong it could be reverted to the previous version again . I ' ll investigate post _ commit hook but I ' ll have to find a way to do a backup first so that a problem with subversiondoesn ' t kill the site . 
You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.

It might be a good idea to remove info from the table but remember that SQL works pretty fine with millions of rows ! In your case , I ' d run a cronjob every day that removes the rows that got made longer then 48h ! I think that this would be enough .

I am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network . These files can be fairly large ( 500mb + at times ) . I was looking into sending it via TCP but I ' m worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory . There will probably only be one client . Copying to a shared directory isn ' t acceptable either . The only communication required is for the client to say " gimme xyz " and the server to send it ( and whatever it takes to ensure this happens correctly ) . Any suggestions ? 
You use the simple array with the fix size 5.
Yes, yes it is. It is really horrible though. There is also this atrocity:

There are an awful lot of C/C++ libraries out there, most no longer updated. There's not much for C#, but I have seen a couple.

Alternatively, a search for on sourceforge.net has plenty of results.

I am currently developing a system on a server running PHP version 5.1.6 thus I am forced to use Symfony 1.1 in the current environment.

I have attempted to migrate a system from 1.0 to 1.1 and that was a major pain in the rear. How has it been for anyone out there migrating from Symfony 1.1 to 1.2?

Well, keep in mind that (in theory) you have the original code to help, as well as the text of the log messages. The only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names. In addition, many tools (Dotfuscator is one) create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name - this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from, but nowhere near impossible.

I'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan. not just in time. They should be accounted for the story they belong to. Even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated. And now for the hard part: don't be afraid to give high estimates. Realistic is ALWAYS better than too low. ;)

The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
I have a complex site that incorporates alot of javascript and it is getting absolutely KILLED by IE7. How would I go about serving this code: HTML JS In such a way that IE7 never gets the and therefore never hides ?
I used the same approach as Chris Wenham. Under load, performance suffers because new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs need to be allocated for each Enqueue/Dequeue. Regardless, in the Enqueue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, the item added, and Count-1 as the index. In the Dequeue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove, the item removed, and index 0.
The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.

To complement on what Andrew said above, for those of you on OSX you might want to take a peek at /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident.

This is pretty much Python-independent! It's a classic example of Unix interprocess communication. One good option is to use to open a pipe between the parent and child processes, and pass data/messages back and forth along the pipe. Take a look at the , which can set up the necessary pipes automatically while spawning child processes.

I'm not sure why this is marked down. AutoHotkey is an excellent solution when you need to do something that you just can't do using an existing API. It has many safeguards that can be used to ensure that the correct program is targeted. There are many possibilities. The answer that is marked as an answer, isn't an answer. It just an obvious statement which is the reason the question was asked in the first place. I would suggest anyone marking down this answer should first look into AutoHotkey and learn what it can do. It should be built into windows.

The inner loop returns to the caller regardless of the outcome. You should after the loop completes. Also, don't use . It's confusing (probably why you got it wrong (it should have been )) and you can just use the equality operator: , which is well-defined for (in case you were worried about the whole, "Don't compare using equality!" thing). But what you really should do is store the data in a map keyed on username and do a direct lookup:
You need to implement the interface so that will use your iterator .

At work we use teraterm and realterm for checking serial data is correctly formatted. Also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port. Windows allows you access to the serial port via CreateFile.

Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally "fix" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?

Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
Vaibhav : Only one of the assemblies will ever write to the file . 
I have a xml similar to this one : The thing is , Im able to get all the info tags , but I get the results from all dates . I dont know what the dates will be , since the are dynamic generated . What I know is that I may have a data tag with one or two date tags I wish I could show the first dateÂ ´ s info on a list box and the second dateÂ ´ s info on another listbox . How can I do that ? Desirable Output : If thereÂ ´ s a second date then print it too : Thx ! 
This has nothing to do with but everything to do with the absolutely awful markup of your HTML and the lack of . You're going to want to wrap all of this "free-text" inside of a or two, and then make sure you're putting the inside of the Sample CSS: HTML:
Indeed, this is awful. A pity there is no option to change it. Every other IDE/editor I used opened tabs to the right.
So my line extends from one side of my graph to the other, but it doesnt really animate through each data point, I assume I have to add a loop somewhere. Heres the relevant code. Any assistance would be hugely appreciated!!!
Unfortunately, no. That's my major pain when merging vcproj file changes.
Here's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to "Heavy (Bottom Up)". Click the triangle and select "Flame Chart". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:
Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you.
if your memory consideration is only about these integers, then all I say is woooow =)
How do I pull a single column of data out of a filled dataset ? I have a filled dataset object , with a variety of tables . I need to get all of the data that is stored in a particular column in one of the tables , and bind a ComboBox ItemSource to it . ( This may require me to pull the data out and make it into a string collection ... ) If anyone has any bright ideas , it would be very grateful ! 
One workaround is to store the client address in the session. A response wrapper should validate the client address set in the session is same as the one accessing the session.
I had what I believe the same issue is.
I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.

I am using 'simpLESS' program to compile my .less files into .css files on the fly. It is really great! However, after using it only for couple of days, 'simpLESS' stopped copiling the .less into .css files. I have tried to reinstall, redownload and then reinstall, tried other directories, other .less files, tried recompiling manuall - but nothing works. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks!
May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.
This is a stupidity of windows find utility, +1 for feeling my pain.
gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and  although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item  i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone.  i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list  so when i'm planning meals for the week  i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard.  i see the value of the pantry option.  i'll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices.  i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list.  for example  i'd like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i'm shopping at one store and see a great price  i'd know i needed chips.  overall  thisi app gets the job done and it's popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day.
Great to hear! Good luck implementing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask :)
I'm building a little script that changes content and css live on the page based upon the values of various input fields. I'm able to change the content "live" absolutely fine as you'll see here: I'm not able to get this working with the css method using the same principles though: Thanks!
can do it ! And you can find other plugins on the . Note that you cannot use this plugin with github pages. This video is excellent !
great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service  i'd give it five stars. however  this is for the android app  and for that  i can only give it three.  i'd used the ipad app  with it's great "hd" support  which is lacking on some android tablets.  that's not a major issue  but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support.  a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards  expanding their storage space  and many apps can take advantage of it.  it's a shame comixology's app hasn't been able to do this yet.  i don't know if it's concerns over security  if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere  but seriously  it's easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up.  give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars.

That's an excellent idea! I was able to convert the plugin, but it just crashes VS when I click on it in the menu.
What about : ie, without the simple quotes you were putting arround the table name. Or, as you are using double-quoted string, which means variables are interpolated : As a sidenote, in both cases, you must be really sure that doesn't contain any malicious data !
I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?
What options are there to pull a GApps user creation date ? I saw that the Admin SDK is capable of it , is it the only API capable of doing this ? does any of the previous one also capable of ? If possible using GAS , it will be most excellent , Thank you ! 
that what i was afraid of ! cause my knowledge about ajax is zero :(
Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
Can library under GPL be used in the commercial software? How about lgpl?
I assume you ' re using Ken Reitz ' s excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests ( if not , you really should be ! ) Most likely , the problem is that requests doesn ' t add a ' Content - type ' header to multi - part uploads , and packmgr doesn ' t read multi - part bodies with no ' Content - type ' header . So , while a normal ' requests ' POST of a multipart - encoded file would go something this : you instead have to use the longer form , setting an explicit content - type : Note that one side - effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory . 
Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
Fantastic! This makes using ipython with --profile sh the best possible method for me to do this :)
This is one thing that I really hate within development is forms. Below is my code and what I am trying to do is align the inputs with the labels . Is there a rule that you use to help remember when coding forms? CSS: HTML:
For SQL Server 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then Express second. If I did it the other way around, the full SQL install would see Express installed already, and would not continue with the install. It was extremely annoying. Not sure if they fixed this with 2008.
NivoSlider , Flexslider , and others all require the images to be the same width and height . I need a slider that will allow me to have images with varying widths . has a good example , but it only works if you have the slider take up the full width of the screen .

very awesome! You just saved me a boatload of time.
So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?

Whether this is a terrible UI Experience or not depends upon the type of data collected. I once created an online job application system and most of the questions were long and quite detailed. In our testing, we found people often wanted to enter this in a random order and were quite frustrated when they couldn't. However, for a simpler checkout or registration process, particularly where steps depend on earlier steps then validation as you go is definitely preferred.

take a look FILE_NAME executors as these will help with your scheduling and remove the need for the sleep.
I don't know any opensource solutions, and the guys writing this stuff for money can't and won't tell you. Guess you're out of luck :]
Excellent ! It works !
Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.
I haven't noticed the sort of fear that you have. Do you have any specific examples?

I have done some research for "The bast way to insert huge data into DB with C#" then a lot of people just suggested me using SqlBulkCopy. After I tried it out and it really amazed me. Undoubtedly, SqlBulkCopy is very very fast. It seems that SqlBulkCopy is a perfect way to insert data (especially huge data). But why dont we use it at all times. Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?
I ended up with a regular expression:
So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.
I wouldn't class that a problem. If you structure things in a meaningful way, you should be able to look at the JS, see where all the event hooks are. If you're worried too much about it, you *could* set the rel attr to js, or prepent the ID with js_, etc.
excellent app! but add more! this is much better than samsung's equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety. just like in the note 10.1  please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra. i'll be glad to pay for such a feature. makes work so much easier!
In VB.NET 4.0, most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2. It seems as though Microsoft and the VS team have adopted the _ convention, so I don't see an issue with it.
As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.

From netstat -anp | grep I at two different times, I can see HttpClient is not re-using my connections. I connect to the same host every time with different urls such as Why is HttpClient not just re-using the same connection to myhost.com every time? I have the following code for intialization of the Pool that I pass to HttpClient... I see they are using an HttpRoute and have localAddress in the equals which seems odd as HttpRoute should be equal on just hostname and schema(https/http) and that is it, right? Does that have something to do with it? Is this a bug? Performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time!!!!!

So I have a facebook page and a username / llamafont so I obviously want to keep that url . I have had the button on sub pages ( you save phrases and can like / share them on FB ) since before I made the page on FB . When I have added the button to my homepage for my base url , it shows 62k likes - GREAT ! However on my facebook page i only have 107 - I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on FB ? How can I make the 62K likes show up on my page in facebook ? Do I need to add in all the meta og : stuff ? Right now I only have og : image in there . Have I screwed it up for good ? Or can I make FB recognize the likes somehow ? Thanks in advance !

lack of important functions 1/ you can not select multiple images to send at once in this same application. 2/ you can not send photos to friends they didn't move to telegram yet. 3/ no option for copying a fragment of a message. 4/ no automatic sending of any media if the connection is established again (you have to do it manually). not to mention that these features are available in whatsapp. implement these and you will be a serious challenger and gain 5 stars.

I have a Django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server . The application will run on multiple webservers Due to load issues .

My problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly! Does anyone know how I can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item? I've looked at all of the attributes on the asp:Menu control, but I haven't been able to find one for this, but I may have just missed it.

Have tried clearing the cache through host settings and restarting the application and it still won ' t show new rows . Have even tried setting cache settings to non - specified and still won ' t load new rows . Is there a way I can completely reset and get it find the new rows .

I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
You have a data race because of the conflicting read/write access to . This implies that the behavior of your program is not defined. The race condition on is the least of your worries: the program could do anything!

I just came across this idiom in some open-source Python, and I choked on my drink. Rather than: or even: the code read: I can see this is the same result, but is this a typical idiom in Python? If so, is it some performance hack that runs fast? Or is it just a once-off that needs a code review?
You might want to consider using , a replacement for Windows' terrible command-line chrome. It offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs, so it's ideal for IRB.
In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.

When you say it didn't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted wasn't there? I find that hard to believe. It doesn't need any configuration, it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!

If you are really worried about performance, FirstOrDefault is O(n). Your second query is only going to execute if the first is null. You could try using .Any(predicate). First() lends itself to try { } catch which might be better for your situation. You don't really need to worry about performance optimization until it becomes an issue, though.
I don't have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes, *you* must do that.
In my company, we are currently using Qt and are very happy with it. I personnally never had to move a MFC-app into using the Qt framework, but here is something which might be of some interest for you : It's part of Qt-Solutions, so this means you'll have to buy a Qt license along with a Qt-Solutions license. (edit: ) I hope this helps !

Is there a way to aid gmail in making threads? We are currently using same Subjects to do this, but that really uglyfies the subject a lot.
@Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune Your answer there was incredibly helpful! Thank you!
Obligatory I Am Not A Lawyer. Are you violating the legal clauses of the GPL? Probably not. ATI and nVidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for Linux. However, it's important to note that Linux is GPLv2; this may have changed with GPLv3. Are you violating the spirit of the GPL? Yes, and judging from the way your question was written, you already knew this.
The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.
The method in .NET returns a by-ref version of a type, e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing . However, if you already have a , what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old ? There doesn't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by-ref modifier. At the moment I've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly-qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type, but this is horribly dirty...

I'm selecting data from a table where one of 3 columns matches a given search string: But I need to order the results depending on where the match was found, based on a column weighting. I.e. if the match was found in the MODEL column then the row should appear higher in the results than if the match was found in the MANUFACTURER column. With the weighting being 1-MODEL 2-MANUFACTURER 3-DESCRIPTION. All help hugely appreciated, thanks!

MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.
Ah, this was actually dumb...I solved it. I had two checked out directories that were both very much the same. I was in Eclipse and I didn't realize that I had been editing the wrong file all along. STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! Oh well it's not a total loss, now you all get to see how to fix ff3.

Shortcut keys often don't work the same way across all browsers. And they are awful on Opera. And most users won't use them. The only thing I'd bother with on most sites is buttons for next and prev, and I'd also make the alt tag say "next" or "previous" to assist browsers with fast forward.

HXT, a library which is used for parsing XML, is a very good example for the usage of arrows (have a look how often the word occurs in the module names of this package!). You shall have a look on the great tutorial: http://adit.io/posts/2012-04-14-working_with_HTML_in_haskell.htmlBut it is also good to have the arrow concept for functions. For example the following code just works, because is an instance of the arrow class (The operator is defined in Control.Arrow).Thanks to the arrow syntax you have also a great tool to write complex computations in Haskell (it works as well for functions, monads and XML filters in HXT).
This is heinous. I would not allow such a thing to survive a code review.
Additionally you may customize the parsing behavior by providing appropriate dependency properties.

@Rob, the only thing `onclick` should be intended to do is be taken out back and shot. Metadata used to indicate that an element is enhanced in a behavior layer may "smell" depending on implementation (I would personally use `class`, which doesn't repurpose anything), but it doesn't smell anywhere near as awful as a behavior layer that pollutes the global scope, not to mention the data layer.

I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
Excellent ! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as * * the * * answer .

I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
I was afraid of that. Poorly formatted code really bothers me. I guess I'll learn to live with it.

I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?

suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!

Hi Barney, I think @EdMorton 's answer is pretty pretty more powerful than my comment!
You have at wrong place , that must be in element , so You should try : Referred from Here Hope it will help you ! 
I am using the ShowWindow method from User32 to hide a window ( cmd . exe ) from the user ( mainly to prevent them from closing it ) . When the user opens the form , the process is started , and hid , then when the form is closing the process is killed . However , when the form is opened again , it doesn ' t hide the window ( and sometimes doesn ' t the first time ) Can someone help me with this ? 
I understand that server-side validation is an absolute must to prevent malicious users (or simply users who choose to disable javascript) from bypassing client-side validation
Terrible! Why do you post all that code? Three asynctasks. Do we have to dig through all that? You should only post the relevant code.
Why the hell do they deliver Duration, if they cannot instantiate it :-/
Wrote it down for you, hope it works as you expected!
I came across this and really liked their gallery , not sure if the script is in - house or came from some free / commercial script out there ? Thanks 
So I have also ran into this problem . I have found a solution ( it ' s terrible , be warned ! ) Open Unity and load your solution in MonoDevelop 4.0.1 ( older version you can set the target framework more easily ) Navigate to your project directory and open " Assembly - CSharp - vs " in notepad . Change the line " TargetFrameworkVersion " v3 . 5 to " TargetFrameworkVersion " v4 . 0 You will have to do these steps every time you load Unity ( blah ) but it does work . 
@acidzombie24: My pleasure! :)
also check out the project at codeplex which is a tutorial of sorts on parallelization using .net among other things:
like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )
Excellent question . Running a large project in successive version of Python wouldn ' t be very definitive , unless you had , say , unit tests that magically achieved 100 % code coverage , so a tool this would be nice to have . 
That ' s what I ' m going for , I think . If you could help with the code , I ' d be thrilled ! 
Don't. Use a CSS declaration instead.
When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70-80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.
I'm not very sure if this is what would help you, but you could try
Most of the time I ' d simply add a . txt file to the solution or abuse comments to do it . However , if you use the scratch pad to store todo lists et cetera you can use TODO : in your comments and visual studio will add them to the built in todo list . 
I lied. The problem is back with a vengeance... 4009 errors in 229 files. This is ridiculous! VS2013, Resharper 8.0.2.
I build Web service, I define IP connection (all works excellent) but, how I can define the IP in variable ? now, I change with the Find and replace in VS2008 and right click on the Web service properties. thank's in advance
Hey Piper, I saw you posting a lot of `git` questions tonight (which is completely fine!) but just wanted to make sure you were aware of http://gitready.com and the Git Community Book: http://book.git-scm.com/ which might help you with some of your questions. The community book even has some screencasts in it. Again, feel free to ask questions here... just wanted to pass that along to you.
The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times ! You just check whether the stream is in a good state . If not , you ' ll reset the stream and ignore the character . Search for question where this answered . Also , don ' t use exceptions for non - exceptional cases and * always * throw something derived from ` std : : exception ` : once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which isn ' t derived from ` std : : exception ` in a program with a few million lines of code you ' ll find it extremely helpful to look at what ` what ( ) ` returns ! 
Excellent answer below. Would be great if you could mark one as accepted.
Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form (or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.
I would not go the gdi route... Have you considered using wpf?
Is there a way to call out from a TSQL stored procedure or function to a webservice?
Absolutely terrible!!! It is not Dependecy Injection
I would use pure ruby (Matz Ruby Interpreter (MRI)) to start off. My understanding is that iron ruby is not quite ready yet. If you are looking for a good book my current favorite (over pickaxe) is by matz and flanagan, the book is very concise well written paragraphs and they provide great examples (in 1.8.* and 1.9) Enjoy! :D
simply the best i very rarely write reviews. even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it. this app deserves both. i have  seriously  tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need. audio engine is tops  start and stop via headphone jack  great album art download. lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features. i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control. price a little high  that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner. was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but; what the heck- i gave it five.
There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own, but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized, or massive and completely ridiculous. Carried to it's logical conclusion, a complete wrapper for all aspects of an operating system becomes an entire virtual runtime. You might as well make your own programming language.
IMHO multi - core processors are still so rare , and threading is such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go , that you ' re just better off sticking to one thread . 
@BoristheSpider :( :( That is really sad. :(
Heroku is an excellent (free) option: Also, deploying to Heroku is as easy as it gets!
Can you show us your html and css? Fyi... styling select boxes is terribly difficult!
Yeah, I didn't know about the non-greedy thing either! Is there a site that explains each modifier?
I HATE SKYPE!!!
If you disable the shift - key for opening the database , the user should not be able to change your settings . Note that it is possible to lock you yourself out of the db this way . See also : If proctecting your data is critical , you may need t look at a database other than Access , with Access , you can protect from accidental tampering , but really malicious tampering will get through . 
If you are concerned about code re - ordering you are either creating some funky and hard to understand and maintain code , or else you probably don ' t need to worry about it . Can you explain why you think the code snippet you supplied will be reordered ?
