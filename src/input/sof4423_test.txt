Also, it is worth including (in some fashion) the Service Pack downloads as well. In fact, depending on how your executables are built, you might be forced to install the Framework and the Service Packs.
Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful... It is not organised at all, but maybe... shouldn't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the "cur" -> "cursor" change I suggested:
You forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic. Better spare the tester this tedious stuff, so he can concentrate on the nasty testing.

I think you'd be better off with Iterables.
talks about consuming WCF services in Silverlight , but claims : There will be no proxies , no generated code , no 3rd party utilities , and no disgusting " Add Service Reference " usage . What is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my Silverlight project ? Are there hidden overheads ? Or is it a case of Fear Of Auto Magic on the part of the author ?
I am new to android and I can ' t seem to find a step - by - step tutorial on getting the jseinstein slidemenu to work in Android Studio .

As an aside, if you can use a pull parser and not a SAX parser. They're much easier to work with. With SAX you have to worry about saving state between the callbacks.

You should never, ever use . It gets really really slow as the size of table grows. Instead you should . In case you have irrational fear of learning, here is there solution which would do what you ask for:

@Evan It's not compilable java. It's used to navigate the code in eclipse/idea and is excellent if you have a large code base with lots of long class names.
I have set up the gravatar RoR plugin successfully (yeah!) but when someone does NOT have a gravatar account, I want it to display the identicon, which I guess shows up when d=identicon in the gravatar URL...but since I am using the plugin, I am basically saying gravatar_for (user) so...is there a way to add that value?

Sorry -- Current output is raw HTML as far as I know. I'll double check that, though. Warren -- I suppose that is what I'll have to do. Looks quite scary, though!
I'm apologize for saying this, but the code you've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists, and use String.split to parse a comma-seperated list.
I think the first approach is OK , but you have to be sure to always have branch B updated with the new changes introduced in branch A . Otherwise if you don ' t keep them synchronized , these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain . SVN merge ' s are ok if you do them early and often .

I ' m working on a package which includes rescaling of images in PHP . For image rescaling , PHP has the GD and ImageMagick libraries . Are those likely to be part of a given client ' s PHP install already ? Is there a " default " install of PHP , for that matter ? By default , are either GD or ImageMagick included ? If neither is installed , should I have some sort of horrible fallback position of reading , rescaling , and saving GIFs , JPGs , and PNGs , or is it simple to add GD or ImageMagick to an existing install ?

Why use a ` Mutex ` here ? The ` Acquire ` method just returns a reference to an instance ( this is a reference type ) . Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant . The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates . Why do locking ? Even if the instance was not " singleton " or " read - only " , i . e . even if the field reference could change , since [ reference assignments are atomic ] ( http : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 5209623 / ) , there would still be no need for locking / ` Mutex ` . I will downvote this answer @ + 109 net upvotes ...

I had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround. When I was done I didn't really hate it though, because it allowed me to free-up the UIPageViewController and all of it's child UIPageViewControllers and all of their resources when the user wasn't actively using the tab.
Try this , you will avoid the much dreaded IN operator with subqueries ( they can sometimes be inefficient , to say the least ) !
If you are getting thrown off by the fact that the user/group is listed as having "Limited Access" on the ACLs on, say, the parent site/web. That's just a placeholder SharePoint uses to make sure people have access to at least the bare minimum set of objects (e.g. theme and other UI files and the parent web itself) to get to the list or item you actually want them to have access to. As long as the group only has access on a single list, you should have to worry about them having access to anything else.

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?

MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.
When you find yourself doing this, you need to ask yourself if this is the intended way of getting your server started. You shouldn't worry about this and make sure your python and django paths are set correctly. This is ignoring the actual problem.

Does it limit the number of concurrent users? Other than downloading and installing the CRRedist2008_x86.msi on the production server, anything to worry about? (And judging from the comments here and other places, yes it would be better to find another solution, but unless there's something free that works with VS2008/IIS6, we're stuck with it for now).
Suggest adding the following to Peek and Pop(): if ((_stack.Count - 1) < 0) throw new Exception("Cannot Peek or Pop without first doing a Push.");. This would alert the programmer to this corner case, and allow them to keep it in mind when using this class. We could also add a TryPeek or TryPop, which is the approach Microsoft have taken with their ConcurrentDictionary implementations.

One of the first cool demos in the 1.0 era was page turn photo book . The idea caught a bit of traction and Jeff Prosise wrote up a framework for it What I ' m looking for is an update to 3.0 ( or at least 2.0 ) While I appreciate Prosise effort , I ' m not that thrilled about all the Javascript required to drive the application . Any pointers ? This is primarily for a learning exercise , so canned controls are of limited interest .

It doesn't appear to be possible.
I built an xml-rpc server in Python using SimpleXMLRPCServer, according to the example in the Python documentation. I'm calling it from a Python client on the same machine. The body of the server function executes very fast on its own. But I find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow, taking one second per call. (Using xmlrpclib.) A speed-up technique I found on the web () didn't help. My connect URI is: I'm running Python 2.7 x64 on Windows 7, but it works the same for 32-bit Python 2.7.

Does anyone know how to do this ? Or can you at least point me in the right direction ? I don ' t need full wrappers or anything ( ) , just one simple function that will post to Twitter . Thanks !
I have a situation where IE7 hangs accessing my web app. Based on the excellent from , I installed WinDbg to download the IE symbols, setup Process Explorer to use those symbols, and then used Process Explorer to get a stack trace for the hung thread. I have pasted the stack trace below. Does someone more familiar with the IE internals have an idea of what is happening, or a suggestion on how to progress with this?

I was wondering if is there any jQuery plugin or something to create a search bar similar to Mac's Mail app, where you can search inside specific categories, very awesome Thanks in advance!
But they fixed it, and you don't have to worry about it as long as you set the correct doctype, to make IE not be in quirks mode.
Sorting the hashes is also a possibility that I have considered. I'm a bit concerned about memory usage, but I'll worry about that later.
that is simply awesome :-)
My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.

I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect!

I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : (THANKS AGAIN ROB!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder, and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
I have several hundred ( static - no includes or server - side parsing ) HTML pages . I would like to validate the HTML ( XHTML 1.0 Transitional ) , but the idea of plugging each of them individually into the W3C Validator - or even using a Firefox plug - in to open each one - fills me with dread . Does anyone know of any ( Windows ) apps that can do bulk validation ? The " Validate entire site " feature on is the closest I ' ve come , but that ' s limited to 100 pages .
Really great article, thanks!

Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments (could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage. (In this case, I'm using postgres).
I don't have any control over the dataset I recieve. The only thing I know is that it contains everything.

Anti-JavaScript snobbery! Every language uses a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code. JavaScript is just another language, capable of writing "programs" or "scripts".

Typically you would handle that as a POST (not a GET), and read the xml from the request-stream (or there are helpers to let you do this). Otherwise URL encoding and length restrictions are going to make this extremely painful.
Check out GSON for converting POJOs to JSON: We've been using for a couple of years now. Very excellent library. For POJOs to XML, Jersey uses JAXB or you could roll your own serializer.
I have two files . File 1 : a FASTA file with gene sequences , formated this example : File 2 : A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene . Like so . Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1 , but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2 . I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2 . I feel there must be something in the biopython module that could help me , I just don ' t know what . For instance , I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function , but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers . I don ' t know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file . Maybe reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence ... But I really don ' t know .... Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated !
Thanks! Give it a try! It works excellent! If you can build the URL string correctly of course, je
The function is written to expect an array, but you're passing it an integer. Did you mean ? (That does at least print a list of numbers, but I'm afraid many of them are not primes!)
Excellent. Thanks.
writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple!
is a really great option for git . Most of the free , public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license ( and , possibly , your documentation ) . That ' s potentially a different thing that you ' re talking about ( backups ) . For just backups , you may want to try a for - pay service or even something like .
Instead of J#, I would rather prefer IKVM () to convert my JARs to .NET assemblies as well as access Java APIs in C#.

Obligatory I Am Not A Lawyer. Are you violating the legal clauses of the GPL? Probably not. ATI and nVidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for Linux. However, it's important to note that Linux is GPLv2; this may have changed with GPLv3. Are you violating the spirit of the GPL? Yes, and judging from the way your question was written, you already knew this.

Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB

I don ' t think it ' s a matter of which language is better . In the . NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide . There are certain functionality that is available in VB . NET that you might like to use from C # but can ' t .

I started wondering today if it would be possible to integrate Joomla+CB with Google apps. If that would be possible we could have one great product! The first thing that I would want to integrate is the logon-process, one login for Joomla+Google apps.

Pragmatic approach: See other answers for excellent backgrounders!
If its just the quotes you are worried about, then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library, you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.
I agree. It's clear that you are on the threshold of either using a library or writing your own. Go get jQuery and just use it as you see fit in your project, starting with this. Here's to happier days!
I did some research on this a few years ago ( 2005 I believe ) and I liked JNBridgePro as the best third party product to do this . Check it out here Good luck !
This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.

Strangely enough, by slightly changing the 'canonical' rules and starting from a random configuration, Conway's Game of Life (I don't know why my Wikipedia link is not working!) seems to generate pretty nice mazes!

I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).

I have a page running on my local django dev server with the Django Debug Toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but I'm unsure why: Django Debug Toolbar says SQL - 46 queries in 39.80ms And then running a profiler I get 7926 function calls (7774 primitive calls) in 0.024 seconds So I'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the Total CPU Time?

This is flat wrong I'm afraid - you should follow W3C guidelines: http://www.w3schools.com/DTD/dtd_el_vs_attr.asp - XML should not be formed on readability or on making it "compact" - but rather using elements or attributes correctly for the purpose which they were designed for.

Ok, now it is 2014 and you should never use `eval` in order to parse a JSON string because you would be exposing your code to "code injection". Use `JSON.parse(yourString)` instead.

There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own, but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized, or massive and completely ridiculous. Carried to it's logical conclusion, a complete wrapper for all aspects of an operating system becomes an entire virtual runtime. You might as well make your own programming language.

Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not , but then there are two things you could try : 1 . Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist . The class might look this : To access the list you could write : is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it . Else you might get . Also a receiver might start before the list is filled . So always check for null before you use it . 2 . The other option is you store the list in a cache object Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it . Hope that helps !
That's depressing :/ Are you sure I can't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source?

The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.

Filip is both correct and incorrect, at least wrt to Java and ASP.NET. An applet can get access to the ASP.NET session by cheating. In my case, we added the session id as a parameter to the applet, which the applet then adds as a cookie in it's requests. Seems to work ok. (We encrypted the session id to foil those nasty hacker folk!)

I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered, , none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm, and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?
I am sorry for posting so many questions , but getting this to work has been incredibly painful , even tho Testflight makes it much easier I figure this has got to do with my Apple Push Notifications .

You shoud use login.done() , not login.success() :) Success is used inside the ajax() funciton only! The success object function is deprecated, you can set success only as Ajax() param! And there is no need to Parse the data because its in Json format already!

I found a number of people asking the same question starting around 2005, but here is the first google result - also discusses silverlight. As far as I can tell, however, the only thing you would need to worry about would be setting up the mime types and providing access to the files.
How do I make this: Into this:
Not that I recommend this, but totally abusing LINQ the following would work:
No, I'm afraid not! You can call yourself in a js-function from . codebehind:
I need to pass a regex substitution as a variable: This, of course, doesn't work. I tried eval'ing the substitution: but that didn't work either. What horribly obvious thing am I missing here?
How to get button Clicked for single time or Long press on it clicked event?
You'll need to create or call a refresh function from the same place as the alert() in the .get() call. That function is a success post-back.

Just a personal opinion, not an actual answer but... I love those login forms (not pages) which just shows up in the center of the page and after you type in your username and password you are logged in without ever leaving the current page!
is in so u need not to worry!Internally the data is always stored as TEXT, so even if you create table with , SQLite is going to follow the rules of data type
Im maintaining a site where I need to ' click ' a link with javascript . The href is inline javascript , not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead . Im expect this is bad practice ( the rest of the site is terrible ! ) but I need to make the link ' clicked ' with javascript . Im using jQuery . I know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link , which I am not .
7 seconds between asking and answering it yourself? Isn't that abusing the system a little?
Try this: The lets it run over any file (incredibly dangerous!) but the revision specifier limits it to the specific files included in that changelist.
This question appears to be off-topic because it is not about programming. See [What topics can I ask about here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) in the Help Center. Perhaps [Web Apps Stack Exchange](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/) would be a better place to ask.
I've decided to use the FreeFileSync tool from There is some effort to configure it to ignore some files and folders, but the tool provides nice filter possibilities. Configuring these filters can be very time consuming but they're working fine :) Thank's for all your help!

I had heinous problems with this until I disabled my Norton Autoprotect anti-virus software. SO posting tip: include version, OS, etc. of your environment.
Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
Say I have a Employees table (PK is employeeID) and a sales table, where the sales table has a FK column for employeeID. Now when designing my deleteEmployee stored procedure, should I first delete rows in the Sales table or should I create seperate stored procedures to delete in each table, and then worry about that in my business logic layer?
I can't comment (yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing Mr. David Murdoch's advice is the best for Opera ( ). OMG, what a lovely girl he's got btw. I've tried his approach in Opera and I succeeded basically doubling the input tags in this way: This way the 1st element is hidden but it CATCHES the display focus Opera would give to the 2nd input element instead. LOVE IT!
I recently moved from a Mac + Textmate back to Visual Studio. The one thing I absolutely loved about textmate was it's find/search feature. It made navigating solution files so easy. Is there an equivalent shortcut/addon for Visual Studio?
@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.
Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps / build folders / etc . It ' s extremely annoying . If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode , delete the Default - 568 file and make sure to run Clean / Clean Build Folder in Xcode , and delete the app completely off your simulator / device . It should start showing up letterboxed again . Apple is still accepting 3.5 in only submissions .

If you also want to display the date it can be done by using "DATE /T".
Yes, yes it is. It is really horrible though. There is also this atrocity:
@ceejayoz I use svn for development, but I really hate the idea of having many ".svn" folders in production.
FWIW - In regard to 'being more careful in the future' I've really enjoyed using AnkhSVN within my Visual Studio 2010. It's done an excellent job of helping me perform perfect commits
Excellent - now if I set the main ImageView layout_weight to 3 and the inner LinearLayout to 1, I get the 75/25 effect I wanted too! Thanks Kevin!
Can you unaccept the current accepted solution and accept this answer?
Excellent, thanks!
While your basic point is correct , the code you ' ve shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question : Afaik , you get four ` int ` in one cache line , that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data ( not considering prefetching ) , you have conditional jumps in your loop ( modern architectures hate mispredicting those ) , so you get much , much more than a cycle for each loop iteration . I ' d wager , your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles , probably more , but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping ( how many mispredictions are made ) .
I know its possible to accept a list of objects as a parameter but what about a list of Guids from checkboxes? This is a bit different as the only name you get has to be the ID. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

My application has a frame that is loaded/navigated when certain top-level buttons are clicked. The problem is, one of the hosted pages has a frame of it's own, and is messing with the outer frame's navigation bar (clicking back and forward navigates the inner frame, as well as the outer frame). Is there any way to have the outer frame's navigation control only worry about its immediate contents?
Fair enough: if your JDK upgrade messes up Serializable, the clients of the your big boy JDK (i.e. Sun, BEA, IBM, etc.) should scream bloody murder (and I have). Admittedly the question wasn't clear whether it was only about JDK classes.
Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed , I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!
I'm trying to output the following from within a liquid template: Obviously, Liquid sees this as a variable named and tries to do substitution. I'm trying to find out how I can output the actual braces. So far, I've found one method that works, but it's incredibly ugly: Yeah, told you it was gross. Here are other things I've tried: Any advice here?
Thanks for the feedback! It was a pleasure!
This might work for what I have in mind , will certainly give it a try .
Is this possible? I have looked online and cannot seem to find an answer.
@grieve--from what I've read, unit tests should not hit the file system, db, or go accross the network. I'm trying to stick to those rules.

How do I stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window? Yes, I abhor pop up windows too. Yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh. I also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh, UNTIL the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh. I have access to the Flash through our Flash developer, but he is uncertain of how to do this. The closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys, yet it does not appear to be working.

In WPF , how would I apply multiple styles to a ? For instance , I have a control which already has a style . I also have a separate style which I would like to add to it without blowing away the first one . The styles have different TargetTypes , so I can ' t just extend one with the other .
Excellent example and interesting discussion! Thanks everyone!
anyone have any experience of using them together? How well does it work? or is it just too much grief?
This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which Konrad you are referring to.
Shouldn't this be Modulus(CurrentItem + 1, 4)?
Wow, it works! Thanks.
