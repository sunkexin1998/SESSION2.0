Edited my post. Hope it helps; and feel free to keep asking questions!
I figured out the problem. I was writing out the NULL terminator and that's what was causing libxml2 to choke (although I could have sworn I already tried it without the NULL terminator, d'oh!) The fixed code should simply be:
Worked really great! Thanks a ton!
Nope... doesn't fix it I'm afraid!
Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I'm learning to love!

Take a look - email is sent using , so you could just add: to the .
Sometimes youre developing and you decide to commit, forgetting you created a few files on your project. Then a few days down the line your buddy gets your build out of subversion and complains that some files appear to be missing. You realize, ah crap, I forgot to add those files! How can I get a list of the files that are not under version control from subversion so I'm sure I've added everything to the repository?
I have a string with some markup which looks this : I ' m trying to strip away everything except the anchor elements with " entry : / / id = " inside .

Any help ( apart from the " why don ' t you use a parser " : ) would be greatly appreciated !
Great Solution!
Any Updates to this annoying topic?!
Then what should you do?

Is there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all modules (maybe in a particular directory) on each load? While working on the code, it's very annoying to restart apache every time something is changed. The only option I've found so far is to put below every import.. but that's also really annoying since it means I'm going to have to go through and remove them all at a later date..
Awesome solution Binod, works perfectly! This was a lifesaver, thanks so much.
I'm just going through the same process! I was looking at this page: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html which starts talking about coffee shops! At that point I gave up. You've got to love java/oracle documentation!
Very good point! I've changed my example code.

Just use the appropiate font and enclose your string with an asterix.
I'll second the NI Measurement Studio. I've plotted 1000 points/sec with NI Measurement Studio's chart control. Also, this test was done on a laptop with a very lousy video card. AFAIK, Measurement Studio is using OpenGL internally.
Do you have any JNI in your application code? Then maybe you need to worry about 32 vs. 64 bit native binaries. 32 or 64 is all the same to your Java code. The performance aspects already seem well covered by previous posters.
This is a common problem , and it ' s not a matter of " PHP is lying to me ! " You have to understand how PHP sends the emails , and how servers interpret and process them . Your email host is likely interpreting these emails as spam , and sending them to a quarantine folder . None of this has anything to do with how PHP is handling your email .
I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

I did a lot of VRML + Java work in college and loved it , but I feel it ' s not really a marketable skill .

@gnud: No, it's not an implementation detail. It makes it a pain when you've been given an integer in "natural" base (i.e. Jan=1) and you need to use it with the calendar API.

How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock?

If I have a simple piece of data to store (an integer or string for example) I might choose to store that in ViewState, or using a HiddenField control. Why would I choose one over the other? ViewState Hard for the user to decode (thought not impossible), which might be desirable HiddenField Value can be used in JavaScript Are there other pros and cons?
@ joe Yes , if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above , but I don ' t explicitly declare an ivar myself , the compiler will still actually create the ivar . So I could do ` int len = [ self . stringProperty length ] ` as you ' d expect inside the class , AND I can also do ` int len = [ stringProperty length ] ` as well , without using the accessor method , just directly using the ivar ( which the compiler has synthesized for me , along with setter + getter ) . It ' s really fantastic !

I am using Hibernate for my persistence layer . And if I send a web request which asks for some database data to be displayed on the webpage For the first one or two times , the server responds rightly and data are retrieved and displayed .

Also the log message stays at the " opening hibernate session " line ( shown by SessionFactoryUtils class in Spring ) Any solution ? ?

I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.

I think the fact that you have SVN at the moment makes this question less obvious . A managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive . There are many options , and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes .
I know its possible to convert an image to CS_GRAY using however, this is a chokepoint of my entire program. I need to do this often, on 800x600 pixel images and takes about 200-300ms for this operation to complete, on average. I know I can do this alot faster by using one for loop to loop through the image data and set it right away. The code above on the other hand constructs a brand new 800x600 BufferedImage that is gray scale. I would rather just transform the image I pass in. Does any one know how to do this with a for loop and given that the image is RGB color space?
I have an asp:Menu control that has four different menu items in it. Each menu item has a graphic and a text description. My problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly! Does anyone know how I can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item? I've looked at all of the attributes on the asp:Menu control, but I haven't been able to find one for this, but I may have just missed it.

Probably the date format does not match the string and `dateFromString` is `nil`. - Single-stepping in the debugger (and inspecting the variables) can be extremely helpful!

My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow, I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in, and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?
This can probably be done using JavaScript.

At the moment my divs load in one by one on page load. It's absolutely fine!

The clue is : If you actualy have defined the table , then you have suffered the major ( probably only ! ) sqlite gotcha . If the database file doesnt exits it will quietly create an empty database for you . Double check you file path and look for a new empty sq3 file appearing in your directory .
Excellent, I'll try that now, thank you!
I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?

It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program ' s design more precise . Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use . Here ' s how : Be warned that it ' s sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs , but this option won ' t hurt much if you ' re just trying to disable a function . By the way , this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it , it ' s now up to you to choose which method will receive this . Hope this was helpful !

I think what he means is, you can't just read: myService.DoSomething() and go to the definition of DoSomething, because with IoC, myService is just an interface, and the actual implementation is unknown to you, unless you go look it up in xml config files or the main method where your ioc gets setup.

Is there a VB6 equivalent to the C/C++ 'continue' keyword? In C/C++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto. (Ugh!)

Here's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to "Heavy (Bottom Up)". Click the triangle and select "Flame Chart". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:

I'm working on a webservice + AJAX interface, and I'm worried about authentication. This moment I'm passing username and password to the webservice as arguments, but I fear that this approach is highly insecure.

The webservice receives arguments from POST or GET and retreives xml (in a future maybe I'll use JSON)
Creating custom types can be done in PowerShell . Kirk Munro actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly . The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types . The book is excellent all around , so I really recommend it . If you are just looking for a quick way to do the above , you could create a function to create the custom object
Also, the question is why you want to move the column, the other 2 posters have summed up the how, but something about your attempted query worries me: 37 columns is far too many. If you're trying to move a column on table with that many columns, i suspect you are DoingItWrongTM

When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70-80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.
I've seen both this: and this: Does the type attribute matter in any way?
@btevfik..thats very sad:(

I too am using ideas from Rob ' s pattern and for now am updating Pure . Krome . But i think concurrency is too vital to ignore and should be a habit of any enterprise application developer . I ' m ignoring it for now , but it will go in my later iterations . I would really love to see how your approach turns out David .
I've been having a spam problem on my site, where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy IP ban them, except they always come back under a different IP address through a proxy or TOR. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the IP and determine if its a genuine user, or someone behind a proxy, in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.

I ' m trying to create a grid ( matrix ) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows , and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired . The grid should fill squares with random coloring . I ' d also to add a zoom function , so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double - clicked . Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares ? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER : ) I ' m new to canvas , so any method help would be great ! Thanks

Back in the private beta (this question dates back to about a week after the private beta began) the discussion aspect of the site was not terribly well-formed. I didn't really want to state an opinion, merely state an alternative approach. I think the pros and cons have been adequately addressed in the other answers / posts.

How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder, you can easily check the build dependencies, and by testing it within a pbuilder environment, you can check the dependencies.
Your question assumes that mail clients follow the RFC standards for MIME encoding, which they don't. I'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as-it-exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.

The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because, under the covers, it's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words, it's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.

I can only help if I can see the full (ie. non-compressed) source code. The code included on the website has been modified (from jqDock v1.6 source) and re-compressed, which makes it extremely difficult (understatement!) to tell what has been changed. (I have also responded - with the same answer - to a direct email from the poster)
The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an "on demand return" instead of an "always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it.

I know that the eax register is 32 bit while the dl is 8 bit... am I on to something?? How do I go about solving this.
awesome! it works
I ended up writing a python parser myself. I managed to do it by following the spec here: And then taking the code tables from the horde.org cvs. The open mobile alliance's site and documentation are terrible, this was a very trying project :(
I have two different asp.net web applications both referencing the same dll e.g. . I want to know if there is a way of adding some web.config setting to one of the application's config files to avoid the need to have two copies of the dll lying around. My [simplified] directory structure is as follows:
Seems a duplicate question . Please see excellent answer for " [ Should Usings be inside or outside the namespace ] [ 1 ] " [ 1 ] : http : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 125319 / should - usings - be - inside - or - outside - the - namespace
Try to use the System.DateTime class.
Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.
Why do people use "*nix" instead of just typing "unix"? Are you afraid of a trademark lawsuit?
yeah, your pain is mine! This method described by ctrahey at least gives you some clue.

Ergh, this OptionBuilder has a horrible interface!
I am trying to save a ListObject from a .NET 3.5 Excel 2007 VSTO Workbook to a new sheet (done) and save that new sheet to a new workbook (done) without that workbook requiring the VSTO customization file (!!!!!). Has anyone had any luck with this? The only way I've had any success is just saving as a CSV file but that's not exactly acceptable in this case. I'd rather not save to a CSV just to copy back to a XLS file. worksheet.SaveAs(saveDialog.FileName, Excel.XlFileFormat.xlOpenXMLWorkbook)
Dude, you scare me! At least make an effort in PROVIDING CODE!
Try: This should make it open as a pop-up (unless default browser setting are different)Although it's not recommended to use pop ups anymore because most users find it extremely annoying.Hope this helped.

if efficiency is the case, I would use SAX or on a personal preference - StAX
Well, again thanks for your help, it works very great! Have a nice day =)
I really despise SWFObject for this very reason. Maybe you could give a try
as was already established, this is a miserable, horrible, awful, and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective. Anyway, since your question is really about Go's type system, here's how you would define a type with a recursive method.
excellent idea : ) I just added , tests it and works a charm ! Thanks
The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products.
No worries, you should really try to learn css, it helps alot!

Awesome ! Its resolve my issue . But is there any way to copy / move files with billion of numbers and without removing existing files / folders ?
I had similar issue. This article explains why and how to solve it:
I'm afraid you can't!! Weka is not covering that functionality.
You really should look at an NIO framework or . I ' ve used MINA with great success in an enterprise chat server . It is also used in the chat server . Grizzly is used in Sun ' s JavaEE implementation .

What an amazingly great answer. Way to go Cody!
I'm only generating the AutoGeneratedClass. The GenericClass and its GenericHandler() method are hand-coded in a different assembly from the AutoGeneratedClass altogether. So I'm afraid this won't work.
@Suma How can this be a duplicate if the question you mentioned was posted a year after this one?

@Stephen excellent example! Somehow my mind was stuck in 1995 :)
I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !

The prevalence of memory leaks in programs with manual memory management kind of disproves your thesis that it's easy to establish upper bounds of a C/C++ programs's space usage. That said, excellent question!
Is there a implementation in glibc or any of the standard Linux libraries for C? I want to be able to add to a list without worrying about its size. I know std::vector exists for C++, but I need the C equivalent.
This question is still incredibly vague about what you are looking for . I guess your acceptance of an answer , however , lets us reverse engineer the problem .

Excellent and simple.
This worked for me.
@ PankajSharma no , this will still work , because of the GROUP BY clause
I often need to execute custom sql queries in django, and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful. I wonder how fellow Slackers deal with this. Maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom SQL in Django?
found a solution , would still love to see alternatives !
One of my tables in my SQL database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond. I was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should I be worried? My hard disk is 150 GB.
